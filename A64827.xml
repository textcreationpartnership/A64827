            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ee here (Brethren) we make tender unto you, not of <hi>Boccace his Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Novelties,</hi> but of <hi>The hundred and ten Conſiderations of Valdeſſo;</hi> the great importance whereof I ſhall declare unto you. Many both Ancient and Modern have written of Chriſtian affairs, and of them ſome better then others; but who is he next the Apoſtles of our Lord and the Evangeliſts, that hath written more ſubſtantially and divinely then <hi>John Valdeſſo,</hi> would perhaps be hard to find. There be ſome that have left many great and laborious Books; but amongſt them there are alſo many of little importance, and are not much neceſſary to a Chriſtian life, being
<pb facs="tcp:99333:3"/> fraught with unprofitable queſtions, and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophicall diſputations, from whence hath ſprung a thouſand inconveniences in the Church of Chriſt. And to give a proof that I ſay the truth in this matter, I will ſet down ſome of thoſe inconveniences, whereby judgement may eaſily be given of the reſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, though they have written huge Books, yet they did not avoid many falſities, follies, and vanities: for as the wiſe man teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, <hi>Many words cannot want much vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next, theſe great Writers have drawn all the Scriptures to Queſtions and Diſputations, and made as it were an Academy thereof, raiſing ſuch doubts in every thing, as they have made the Doctrine of the Sonne of God and of his Apoſtles, and our moſt certain and infallible hope of eternall life, to become a matter alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether doubtfull. And this which I ſhall now adde, is not of leſſe importance then the other inconveniencies: and that is, that with their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and infinite volumes, they have withdrawn and eſtranged men from the ſtudie of the truely holy Scriptures, and from the contemplation of ſimple verity, and inſtead of Chriſts diſciples have made them mens ſcholars: ſo that we are come to that paſſe, that more and greater credit is given to thoſe which are termed Doctours (as if ſo be Chriſt and his Apoſtles were not the true and eternall Doctours and Maſters of the
<pb facs="tcp:99333:3"/> Church) then to the ſimple doctrine of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>This is the benefit and edification that the Church hath reaped from theſe huge Volumes, which our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (the ſafety of his Church being more deare unto him then his own life) he hath ſtirred and raiſed up ſome, and opened their eyes, to the intent that they ſhould by little and little reduce his ſheep to the green and healthfull paſtures of holy Scripture, and to the pure, clear, and ſweet fountains of Gods word. And herein every one hath buſied himſelf according to his talent, that is, the gift which he hath received. But to me it ſeems, &amp; I hope it will do ſo likewiſe to all that have a true reliſh of Chriſts Doctrine, that this our Authour in theſe divine Conſiderations, and ſome other writings of his, hath ſo well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and propounded to all our conſiderations the duties of a Chriſtian man, that there are but a few, yea, very few that can go before him. He hath not indeed writ ſo huge a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, nor ſcribled ſo much paper: No, the Books which he hath written are little and few, but pure, clear, and truly Divine.</p>
            <p>Many have written of the virtues, manners, and duties of a wiſe and good man, as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Panetius,</hi> and <hi>Cicero;</hi> and amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> and in our age <hi>Thomas Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorius:</hi> but none of all theſe hath intreated
<pb facs="tcp:99333:4"/> with ſuch ſublimity, nor made ſuch effectuall demonſtration, nor diſcourſed with ſuch ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nor with ſuch majeſty, nor with ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, nor with ſuch grace, as our <hi>Valdeſſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, this is that which truly deſerves to be entituled the book of Chriſtian duties, the book of Chriſtian demonſtrations, and of truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>Herein is ſhewed the Originall, the Cauſe, the Progreſſe, and the End of every motion, of every action, of every event that is done under heaven, either by God, or the devil, or by the godly, or by the wicked man; and all this from clear, certain, and unqueſtionable Principles of holy Scripture, accompanied with ſo good and proper examples, and ſimilitudes, and compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and diviſions, &amp; definitions, that unleſſe we will be too too obſtinate, and out of common ſenſe, we muſt needs come to agreement touching that which a man ows unto God, to himſelf, and to his neighbour. And further, what the benefit of Chriſt is, and to whom it is profitable, what the infirmity, &amp; what the power of Chriſt is, his abaſement and his exaltation, our own mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and our vivification, election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and a thouſand other ſuch like good and profitable heads are here to be clearly learned, in ſuch manner, as growing practick in this book, you ſhall come to underſtand all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to holy Scripture, better then by the great and many Commentaries of many others.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99333:4"/>
            <p>Now for this great and heavenly treaſure we are all debtours to <hi>Vergerius,</hi> as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Divine providence, in cauſing it to be printed for the view, and injoyment of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. He coming from Italy, and leaving his feigned Biſhoprick to come unto a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip, whereunto he was called by Chriſt, brought with him many excellent compoſitions; doing herein, as men uſe to do when their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are on fire, or their City ſacked, and ruined; every one endeavours to eſcape away with the beſt and moſt precious things that he hath: ſo our <hi>Vergerius</hi> eſteeming nothing more dear then the glory of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, brought away with him thoſe things, which might beſt ſerve to the illuſtration and enlargement thereof. He abandoned therefore the earthly treaſures, and brought away with him the heavenly and divine treaſures, amongſt which this is one of the beſt, and moſt rare that can be imagined. And knowing that good and excellent things become ſo much greater, better, and more praiſe-worthy, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more common; he left unto me theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten Conſiderations, that I ſhould cauſe them to be put in print, which I have, as you ſee accordingly, performed with as much diligence as I have known, or been able to uſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations as many well know,
<pb facs="tcp:99333:5"/> were firſt written by the Author in the Spaniſh language, but afterward by a certain pious and worthy perſon tranſlated into Italian. Yet have they not been able altogether to quit thoſe forms of ſpeech which are proper to Spain. And beſides there are ſome words, though not many, of the language of the Author. For <hi>John Valdeſſo</hi> was by Nation a Spaniard of noble kindred, of an honourable degree, and a reſplendent Chevalier of the Emperour, but a much more honourable and reſplendent Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier of Chriſt. True it is, he did not much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Court, after that Chriſt had revealed himſelf unto him, but abode in Italy, ſpending the greateſt part of his life at Naples, where with the ſweetneſſe of his Doctrine, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his life, he gained many Diſciples unto Chriſt; and eſpecially among the gentlemen, and Cavaliers, and ſome Ladies: he was very eminent, and moſt praiſe-worthy in all kind of praiſe. It ſeemed that he was appointed by God for a Teacher, and Paſtour of noble and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious perſonages: Although he was of ſuch benignitie, and charity, that he accounted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf debtour of his Talent to every mean and rude perſon, and became all things to all men, that he might gain all to Chriſt. And not this alone, but he gave light to ſome of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preachers of Italy, which I very well know, having converſed with them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:99333:5"/>
            <p>He never had wife, but lived moſt continent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor did he attend to ought elſe, aſmuch as he could, then unto true Mortification, in which death overtaking him, he became perfectly mortified, ſo to be perfectly quickned in the reſurrection of the juſt, and to enjoy our Lord Chriſt. He died in Naples about the yeare 1540. He hath left behind him alſo certain other good and pious Compoſitions, which as I hope ſhall by <hi>Vergerius</hi> his means be communicated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>
            <p>Go to then, Brethren and Siſters, in the love of God, and in the precious bloud of Chriſt Jeſus, take this Treaſure, and think withall, that the benefit lyes not in having, and poſſeſſing it, but in the uſe and fruit that is hence to be gathered. He hath made conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe good things not to give nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the imagination onely, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to put in execution that which hath been conſidered and reſolved on. It is neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that we ſhould have the knowledge, but it is neceſſary likewiſe to accompany the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice therewith, becauſe the commendation of every virtue and art conſiſteth in the practice, and in the performance of action agreeable to that vertue and art.</p>
            <p>And you that waſte all your time idly in reading of <hi>Boccace</hi> his hundred Novelties, and the like, lay them awhile aſide, and read theſe
<pb facs="tcp:99333:6"/> Conſiderations of <hi>Valdeſſo,</hi> which are indeed true Novelties. For in them is treated of that great, Divine, and joyfull, new and gladſome tydings of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, of the great Pardon for ſinnes, of the Reconciliation made with God by the death of the Sonne of God. Here you ſhall find the true and holy Enamourments of God, and of Chriſt with mankind. Here you ſhall find the true Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the true kiſſes given by means of the holy Spirit. And laſt of all, you ſhall here find where the true delights and pleaſures of thoſe ſouls are, which are enamoured of God and of Chriſt, and diſenamoured of the world.</p>
            <p>And if happely the language ſeem not ſo ſpruce and dainty, as that of <hi>Boccace,</hi> call to mind that which great Paul the Apoſtle of Chriſt Jeſus hath ſaid, that the kingdome of God ſtands in the power of the Spirit, and not in excellency of ſpeech. Howbeit to ſay truth, neither is this manner of ſpeech to be ſlighted: For I verily find it exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and good to expreſſe that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that is the chief virtue of every Writer.</p>
            <p>But I will here put an end to my diſcourſe, that I may no longer deprive you of the ſacred reading of theſe Divine Conſiderations, which you alſo reading, and that with diligence, and prayers to God for me and all others, ſhall take
<pb facs="tcp:99333:6"/> into due conſideration: To the end, that we may come all to be enamoured of Chriſt, and incorporated in him, as he is incorporated in us; To whom be Honour and Glory ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting!</p>

            <p>MY dear and deſerving Brother, your <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> I now return with many thanks, and ſome notes, in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will diſcover ſome care, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not in the midst of my griefs; First for your ſake, becauſe I would do nothing negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently that you commit unto me; Secondly for the Authors ſake, whom I conceive to have been a true ſervant of God; and to ſuch, and all that is theirs. I owe diligence; Thirdly for the Churches ſake, to whom by Printing it, I would have you conſecrate it. You owe the Church a debt, and God hath put this into your hands, (as he ſent the fiſh with money to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi>) to diſcharge it: happily alſo with this, (as his thoughts are fruitfull) intending the honour of his ſervant the Authour, who being obſcured in his own countrey, he would have to flouriſh in this land of light, and region of the Goſpel, among his choſen. It is true, there are ſome things which I like not in him, as my fragments will expreſſe, when you read them; nevertheleſſe I wiſh you by all means to publiſh
<pb facs="tcp:99333:12"/> it, for theſe three eminent things obſervable therein: First, that God in the midſt of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſhould open the eyes of one to understand and expreſſe ſo clearly, and excellently the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Goſpel in the acceptation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe (as he ſheweth through all his Conſiderations,) a thing ſtrangely buried, and darkned by the Adverſaries, and their great ſtumbling block. Secondly, the great honour and reverence, which he every where bears towards our dear Maſter and Lord, concluding every Conſideration almost with his holy Name, and ſetting his merit forth ſo piouſly, for which I do ſo love him, that were there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, I would Print it, that with it the honour of my Lord might be publiſhed. Thirdly, the many pious rules of ordering our life, about mortification, and obſervation of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome within us, and the working thereof, of which he was a very diligent obſerver. Theſe three things are very eminent in the Authour, and overweigh the defects (as I conceive) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the publiſhing thereof.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How it is to be underſtood, that man was created after the Image and Likeneſſe of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have many times endeavoured to underſtand in what properly that <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> of God doth conſiſt, in the which the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, Gen. 1.27. Man was created: and whileſt I have endeavoured to underſtand this by reading, I have not profited at all; for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding drew me now to one opinion, and by and by to another, untill at laſt endeavouring to do it by conſideration, it ſeemed to me that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or at leaſt that I began to underſtand it. The ſame God which hath given me that which I have attained, ſhall (I am aſſured) give me that which I yet want.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> of God, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, conſiſteth in his proper eſſence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is impaſſible, and immortal; yea alſo, good, mercifull, juſt, faithfull, and true. With theſe Qualities, and with theſe perfections, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that God created man in earthly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, where, before he became diſobedient to God, he was impaſſible, and immortal; yea, alſo he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99333:13"/> was good, mercifull, juſt, faithfull, and true.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſſe</hi> of God, the firſt man loſt by his diſobedience to God, and ſo he became paſſible and mortall; yea alſo wicked, cruell, impious, unfaithfull, and a lyar.</p>
               <p>Having underſtood this by conſideration, I come to compare it with the doctrine of holy Scripture, and I find it agreeable with that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Epheſ. 4.22, 23. and Coloſ. 3.9, 10. (where he ſpeaketh of putting off the old man, and putting on the new,) and by this I am confirmed in my conſideration.</p>
               <p>Moreover I conſider that this <hi>Image</hi> of God was in the perſon of our Saviour Chriſt; in his ſoul before his death, being good, mercifull, juſt, faithfull, and true; and in his body after his reſurrection, being altogether impaſſible and immortall.</p>
               <p>Finally I underſtand, that they, who being called and drawn by God unto the grace of the Goſpel, make the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to become their own, and are incorporated in Chriſt, do in this preſent life recover, in ſome meaſure, that part of the <hi>Image</hi> of God, which appertains to the ſoul; and in the life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they recover that part alſo which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the body. And by this means we ſhall all come, through Chriſt, to be like unto God, as Chriſt is; every one in his own degree, Chriſt as the Head, and we as the Members.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:99333:13"/>
               <p>And verily it ſhall be a marvellous happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſee goodneſſe, mercifulneſſe, juſtice, faithfulneſſe, and truth in men; and to ſee them alſo impaſſible, and immortall, to ſee them much like to Chriſt, and to ſee them much like to God; and to ſee, that together with this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of men, the glory of God encreaſeth, and the glory of the ſonne of God encreaſeth; by whoſe means we ſhall all acknowledge that we have obtained our happineſſe, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for our Head the ſelf ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That mans happineſse conſisteth in knowing God, and that we cannot know God except we firſt know Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny men have deſired and laboured much to underſtand in what a mans happineſſe doth properly conſiſt; and having endeavoured this, as men, by humane wiſdome, have all of them erred in their imaginations, as they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe erre almoſt in all other things, which they endeavour to know by humane wiſdome onely.</p>
               <p>This matter, which I ſay, ſo many have with much labour deſired to underſtand, Jeſus Chriſt our Lord teacheth us in one word, ſaying, <hi>This is eternall life, that they may know thee the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent, Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 17.3. As if he ſhould have ſaid,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99333:14"/> herein conſiſteth mens happineſſe, <hi>That they ſhould know God and Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how ever Chriſt teach it, none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, but they that leave to be men, that is, they which leave the image of Adam, and take the image of Chriſt: for theſe onely know Chriſt, and in Chriſt, and through Chriſt, they know God.</p>
               <p>Men, whilſt they remain ſtill men, come indeed to a certain kind of knowledge of God, by the reading of holy Scripture, and by the contemplation of the creatures, but they find not <hi>happineſſe</hi> in this knowledge. For in truth <hi>happineſſe</hi> doth not conſiſt therein. But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts onely in that <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> which they get that leave to be men, and know God, as they are incorporated in Chriſt, firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt. And, as I underſtand, the reading of holy Scripture, and the contemplation of the creatures, ſerve to encreaſe and augment in them that knowledge of God, in which happineſſe and eternall life are found.</p>
               <p>That knowledge of God, which they get who know him by the creatures, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is like to that knowledge, which an ill Painter gets of a moſt perfect Painter, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things which he hath depainted. And that knowledge of God, which they get who know him by the holy Scriptures, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is like to that knowledge which an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99333:14"/> and unlearned man gets of a famous lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, by reading the things which he hath written. And that knowledge of God, which they get who know Chriſt, and are incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Chriſt, as I underſtand, is like to that knowledge which I have of the King, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen his image, and by having had very particular information of all his uſages, by the relation of perſons, who are very inward with the King.</p>
               <p>Having underſtood this, I underſtand in what the happineſſe of man doth conſiſt, and I find my ſelf to be happy; and I underſtand much better then I did before, the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that men have to God, and to the Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In what the Sonnes of God differ from the Sonnes of Adam.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SAint Paul ſaith, <hi>They which are led by the ſpirit of God, they are the ſonnes of God,</hi> Rom. 8.14.</p>
               <p>And certainly ſo it is, that he that is the Son of God ſuffers himſelf to be ruled and governed of God; and he who ſuffers himſelf to be ruled and governed of God, is the Sonne of God. And on the contrary, they who rule and govern themſelves by humane wiſdome, which Saint Paul calls the wiſdom of this world, 1. Cor. 1.20.
<pb facs="tcp:99333:15"/> they are the ſonnes of Adam: and the ſonnes of Adam rule and govern themſelves by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, neither knowing, nor feeling any other regiment, or government: I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this regiment, and government, as well touching that which belongs to the body, as touching that which belongs to the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The ſonnes of Adam ruling and governing themſelves by their own humane wiſdome, have certain Rules and Medicines to maintain and keep themſelves healthfull, and they have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to regain health when they are ſick or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; as Herbs and Roots, and many other things, that ſerve to this effect. But the difficulty is, to know at what time and ſeaſon to make uſe of theſe things, which is almoſt impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſonnes of Adam have for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and keeping their ſouls in purity and ſimplicity, the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> But the difficulty is, to know how to underſtand this Law, and this Doctrine, and how to apply and make uſe of it, which I hold to be more impoſſible. And in caſe that both the one and the other were poſſible, I ſhould peradventure ſay, that as if they knew how to make uſe of the creatures, they might maintain themſelves in bodily health and ſtrength; ſo likewiſe if they knew how to make uſe of the holy Scriptures, they might maintain their ſouls in ghoſtly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99333:15"/> health. But holding both theſe for impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, I conclude, that it is not poſſible for a ſonne of Adam to maintain the health either of his ſoul, or of his body.</p>
               <p>The ſonnes of God endeavouring daily to mortifie their humane wiſdome, and not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der nor govern themſelves by it, though they make uſe of the common food and medicines which the ſonnes of Adam do; yet they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce the vertue and power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, depending and truſting onely upon the love and goodneſſe of the Creator, who is their Father and Phyſician, and by whom they are immediately governed and maintained in bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health; if not as much as they themſelves would, at leaſt as much as is ſufficient, and may ſerve for their ſouls good, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing.</p>
               <p>It is true, God ſuffereth them to fall into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and ſickneſſes, ſometimes to mortifie them, ſometimes to try them, and ſometimes that they may know him for their Father and Lord: he oft-times healing them without uſing the medicines, which the ſonnes of Adam uſe.</p>
               <p>So alſo in the purity and holineſſe (which is the health) of the ſoul, the ſonnes of God grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily in grace, and perfecting themſelves in holineſſe, as they of Samaria, John 4.42. ſaid unto the woman, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves,</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:99333:16"/> ſo they ſay of the holy Scriptures, now we live and grow in ſpirituall ſtrength, not by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or outward relation of the Scriptures, but by the inward teaching and anointing of the heavenly ſpirit of truth, this is that which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and governeth us in the wayes of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And ſo long as he abideth in us, and we in him, we need no other guide, becauſe we are hereby led unto God our father in heaven.</p>
               <p>And as it is poſſible that a man may be the ſonne of God, and ſuffer himſelf to be ruled, and governed of God: ſo is it poſſible, that a ſonne of God may keep and maintain himſelf in bodily and ſpirituall health.</p>
               <p>The ſonnes of God do make uſe of phyſick for the health of their bodies, and of the holy Scripture for the health of their ſouls; but this they do, without putting confidence in them, for all their truſt and confidence is in God onely.</p>
               <p>They make uſe likewiſe, to preſerve the health of their bodies, of the obſervation of times, and places; as they make uſe of ſome rules to preſerve the health of their ſoules. This they do rather to conform themſelves outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the ſonnes of Adam, then becauſe they feel themſelves to ſtand in need of ſuch obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: foraſmuch as they being governed by God alone, obſerve the will of God, and wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on it.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99333:16"/>
               <p>Theſe truths they underſtand that prove them, others find in them many intricacies: <hi>For the naturall man perceives not the things that are of the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 2.14. alwayes he blames them, and condemns them.</p>
               <p>That I may be the better underſtood, I put this example: There are two men would paſſe a great river by wading; there comes to them one that is experienced in the river, and ſaith unto them in this manner; If you will paſſe over of your ſelves alone, you are to enter here, and when you are entred, you are to govern your ſelves thus, and thus: But if ſo be you will that I ſhould lead you over, come after me and fear not.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two men, one confident in his own wiſdome, upon that which hath been told him, puts himſelf alone into the water: by him I mean <hi>the ſonnes of Adam.</hi> The other having confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him that is experienced in the river, goes after him: by him I underſtand <hi>the ſonnes of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I hold that the preſumption and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the ſonnes of Adam, is much greater folly then that of him, who when he might paſſe the river with a guide and ſafely, puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the hazard to paſſe it alone; ſo I hold that the prudence and diſcretion of the ſonnes of God, that ſuffer themſelves to be ruled and governed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, is much greater
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99333:17"/> then that of that man, that chooſeth rather to paſſe the river with a guide, then alone.</p>
               <p>And it is to be underſtood, that in as much as we are <hi>incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, in ſo much are we the ſonnes of God.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>From whence the revengefull affection proceeds in men: And what effects the long ſufferance hath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God deferreth the revenge of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which men do unto him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PUtting on one ſide all the offences that from the beginning of the world untill this preſent day have been done by men one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſetting on the other ſide onely thoſe, which one man in one day onely doth to God, it ſeems to me that thoſe done againſt God, are beyond all compariſon more in number, and greater in weight, then thoſe done againſt men.</p>
               <p>Conſidering further the revengefull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in men ſo extreme, that there are very few injured who being able to revenge themſelves, do not take revenge: And conſidering in God, that he being able with one beck utterly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all thoſe that offend him, he doth not, but rather tolerates them, yea, and gives unto them of his good things; I have ſet my ſelf to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whence this <hi>revengefull affection</hi> in men proceeds, and what effects the Patience of God doth work. And I find, that the <hi>revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99333:17"/> affection</hi> in men proceeds from the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the firſt man; for I am aſſured that if humane nature had not been depraved, men would have been moſt eſtranged from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. For the firſt man being created after the image and likeneſſe of God, it is a manifeſt thing he was created with an affection eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from revenge, as we know God is. This for that which belongs to men. From the <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> with which God ſuffers the injuries which are ordinarily done him, I conſider, that all theſe effects proceed worthy (according to my judgement) of great conſideration.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that many of the injurers and impious, become ſervants and pious, which would not come to paſſe, if they were taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in their injuring.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that if God ſhould ſuddenly conſume the wicked, in a ſhort ſpace all the wicked that are in the world would be taken away; and there being no wicked, the pious would not have the means to exerciſe their pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the which is neceſſary ſhould be exerciſed, to the intent that being purified, it may ſhine out to the glory of God.</p>
               <p>The third is, that pious men conſidering how God is eſtranged from revenge, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring themſelves that that which belongs to them in this preſent life, is to recover the image of God, with which the firſt man was created,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99333:18"/> they ſhould reduce their minds to leave all affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of wrath and revenge; ſaying, when they are tempted to revenge, theſe and other like words, <hi>My intent is to recover the image and likeneſſe of God, with which the first man was created. This was altogether eſtranged from revenge, forasmuch as God being able to revenge himſelf, doth not revenge himſelf: and therefore it belongs not to me to revenge my ſelf, but to do that which my God doth, to whom I endeavour to make my ſelf like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe three effects I find redound to the gain of the pious: And I find other two which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the damage of the impious.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which is, that by how much they live the longer, by ſo much the more do they offend, and do injuries: And thus they treaſure up unto themſelves wrath and eternall condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Rom. 2.5.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that with the unquietneſſe and trouble which they ſuffer in their conſciences, they begin to feel in this life that which they are to ſuffer in the other; and thereupon they deſire to die, ſuppoſing to be free from this their puniſhment, and on the other ſide, they would not die, fearing leſt their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be augmented unto them. In ſo much, that through the patience wherewith God ſuffers and deferres the revenge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries which men do unto him, I find three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99333:18"/> to the godly, and two damages to the wicked. Whereupon it ſeems to me, that even as the good redounds to the damage of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; ſo alſo that which ſeems evil, redounds to the profit of the pious, that do hold and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that piety, which is obtained by faith in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>I will here adde three things, the firſt, that God commanding me that I ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them that do me injury, it is the ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>me as if he commanded me that I ſhould be like unto him, and that I ſhould do as he doth. Secondly, that the affection of revenge proceeds from a baſe mind, and that the inclination to pardon proceeds from a generous. Thirdly, that a Chriſtian man ſeeing that he can with greater eaſe pardon an injury, then revenge it, he knows that God requires that, which is very eaſie for him to do, and that which is more convenient for him, and more profitable to him. And by this means I know how great the love is which God bears unto men, for whom he hath executed the rigour of his juſtice upon his onely begotten Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>NAturally man truſteth not to another man, but for that which he cannot do of himſelf;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99333:19"/> nor doth he put confidence in God, except for that which he knows and ſees that he is not able to obtain by means of any creature: ſo great is the impiety of mans mind. And hence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that he who hath greater help of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doth bring himſelf with the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to have confidence in God.</p>
               <p>That this is true, we ſee that amongſt ſick people, they onely are brought to ſubmit to the will of God, that have not the means to pay Phyſicians, nor procure phyſick; and they wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> although they have means, are in ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they have no hope at all in Phyſician or phyſick.</p>
               <p>From whence I conſider the perverſneſſe of man, and alſo the goodneſſe of God, in as much as he doth help and favour them who when they can do no otherwiſe, commit themſelves to his divine will: And in our neceſſities, he doth not ſo much regard how pious, or how impious we be, as he doth the truth of his own promiſe, to help and relieve us whenſoever we call upon him and truſt in him.</p>
               <p>That this is true, we have the proof every houre, not onely in our ſickneſſe, but alſo in all other things that befall men in this preſent life.</p>
               <p>This which we ſee by experience in outward things, we may alſo ſee in inward, forasmuch as a man is never brought to truſt and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for his juſtification, reſurrection, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99333:19"/> eternall life, untill he ſee and know that this cannot be obtained by means of the creatures.</p>
               <p>Now conſidering that as well for outward, as for inward things the rich man hath the means, according to his own opinion, to be able to ſerve himſelf with the creatures, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring and reſigning himſelf to the will of God, that he ſhould do with him according as it ſeems good to him; I know the cauſe why Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>a rich man enters with difficulty into the kingdome of Heaven.</hi> that is, comes to reſigne himſelf unto the will of God, and to ſuffer himſelf to be ruled and governed by God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the regiment and government of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, and renouncing the help of the creatures.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I gather, that he whom God will ſet in his kingdome, whether he be rich, or whether he be poor, firſt he opens his eyes, that he may ſee his own utter diſability, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility that all creatures have to be able to give him that which he pretends to, and would have.</p>
               <p>And I conſider, that the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pious and the wicked, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend themſelves to God, conſiſteth in this, that the wicked recommendeth himſelf to God, becauſe he can do no otherwiſe, and the pious recommendeth himſelf to God, even vvhen he might help and ſerve himſelf with the creatures,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99333:20"/> and this as well in outward things, as alſo in inward. And I ſuppoſe that a man may come to know vvhen he truſteth in God for invvard things, by that vvhich he ſhall find in himſelf touching his truſting in God for outvvard.</p>
               <p>They vvhich are in the <hi>kingdome of God</hi> after this manner vvhich I have ſpoken of, are the <hi>poore in spirit,</hi> vvhich Chriſt commends. And ſuch an one did David feel himſelf, vvhen he called himſelf <hi>poore and needy.</hi> And they, as I underſtand, have in part obtained that vvhich is demanded, vvhen vve ſay, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> Gods good ſpirit being come into their hearts, vvhich teacheth them to depend upon God for all things, both of this life and of the life to come.</p>
               <p>And conſidering the felicity that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the being and perſevering in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I underſtand the cauſe vvhy Saint John began his preaching from this ſaying, Matth. 3.2. <hi>The kingdome of God is at hand:</hi> and vvhy our Lord Chriſt ſo began his preaching: and vvhy he ſent the Apoſtles to preach and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvade men to enter into this kingdome, Matth. 4.17.</p>
               <p>Whence I gather, that the beginning and end of Chriſtian preaching, ought to be to preach the <hi>kingdome of God,</hi> and to perſvvade and urge men that they ſhould enter thereinto, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the kingdome of the vvorld, and all that appertains thereunto.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99333:20"/>
               <p>The man that hath entred into, and doth perſevere in this kingdome, I conſider that he is planted in God, as a tree is planted in the earth: And as the tree maintains it ſelf, and produceth flowers and fruits by the virtue which the earth communicates unto it; ſo he alſo that continueth in the kingdome of God, maintains himſelf, and produceth flowers and fruits by the ſpirit of God which governeth and ruleth him. And he that is ſuch, is the ſonne of God, is juſt, and ſhall be glorious, and have everlaſting life: for he is conformable to Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God. And he that is ſuch an one, doth (as it were for vantage) enjoy of the things of this preſent life, little or much, according to Gods good will, and to the ſetting forth of Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Between that which they that are without this kingdome of God, know and underſtand of it, by that which they reade and heare; and that which they who are in it underſtand and know of this kingdome, by that which they feel and prove in themſelves, I know a much greater difference, then between that which they know and underſtand of the regiment and government of a moſt perfect king, by that which they read and heare, being themſelves out of the ſame; and that which they know and underſtand of it, by that which they ſee and prove, being themſelves under the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:99333:21"/>
               <p>I will adde this, which in my judgement is to the purpoſe, that according as the qualities of the herbs that are in the ſame medow are different, ſo they do diverſly participate of the virtue of the earth, ſome more ſome leſſe, and ſome in one manner, and ſome in another: Even ſo as the conſtitutions of them who are in the kingdome of God are different, ſo doth God diverſly communicate unto them of his ſpirit, to one more, to another leſſe; to one after one manner, and to another after another; and all are in the ſame kingdome, and all participate of the ſame ſpirit, even as all the herbs in the ſame medow do participate of the ſame virtue of the earth. And as the herbs, if they had ſenſe, would affirm that what hath been ſaid of them is true; ſo alſo they that appertain to the kingdome of God becauſe they have the ſpirit, do affirm that which is ſaid of them to be true, acknowledging it altogether from the favour of God, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN every man not quickned by the holy ſpirit, I conſider two depravations, one <hi>Naturall,</hi> the other <hi>Acquiſite.</hi> The Naturall I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be expreſſed in that of Job, <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> not one;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99333:21"/> and in that of David, <hi>I was conceived in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> and in that of S. Paul, <hi>We were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the children of wrath:</hi> and likewiſe in all thoſe places of holy Scripture, in which this humane nature of ours is condemned. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite I underſtand in that, <hi>All fleſh had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his wayes;</hi> and in that of S. Pauls, <hi>I was alive once without the Law;</hi> and generally in all thoſe places of Scripture where the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our fleſh is ſpoken of. From the naturall proceeds the acquiſite, and by the acquiſite the naturall is inflamed.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two Depravations I underſtand that the naturall cannot be repaired but by grace, and that they onely are free from it, who enter into the kingdome of God by faith, and come to be the ſonnes of God by the holy ſpirit which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in them; In ſuch ſort, that in them, who knowing Chriſt by Revelation, and accepting the covenant which he made between God and man, believe, and becauſe they believe are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized; the naturall depravation is repaired, and they remain onely with that which is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; from which they go on freeing themſelves by little and little, the ſpirit of God helping them therein. And whileſt they go on freeing themſelves of it, that wherein they offend is not put to their account of ſin, becauſe they be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in Chriſt Jeſus: for S.

               <argument>
                  <p>It is Gods will that we ſhould commit unto him the iſſue and ſucceſſe of all our deſires.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN effect it is true, that we underſtand many things by experience, which we ſhould not underſtand by knowledge; as this, I having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes determined to do many things, the one more pious, holy, and Chriſtian then another, and having ſeen, for the moſt part, the iſſue and effect to be quite contrary to what I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and on the contrary, obſerving that ſome other pious and Chriſtian things were done by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99333:22"/> me, without my predetermination or forecaſt; I ſtood as it were confounded in my ſelf, not underſtanding in what this ſecret did conſiſt.</p>
               <p>I did not wonder, that in things which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined as a man, the contrary ſhould come to paſſe of that which I would; but I did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that in the things which I determined as a Chriſtian, the ſame ſhould befall me. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf in this confuſion, it came to paſſe that I read that reſolution of S. Peter, <hi>Though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi> And conſidering that although the reſolution was pious, holy, and Chriſtian, the contrary of that which he reſolved, befell him; I underſtand that my determinations had not their iſſue and effect according to my deſire, becauſe I did not well conſider mine own utter diſability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any holy and good work.</p>
               <p>So that I underſtood by experience, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God puniſhed my inconſiderateneſſe, in not ſuffering that to come to paſſe which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; yet on the other ſide he ſatisfied my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſire of doing good, by ſuffering that to come to paſſe, which I did not procure, nor hope, nor pretend unto. Whence I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <hi>That the will of God is, that I ſhould depend on him in ſuch manner, that I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine or propound nothing, without holding him before mine eyes, ſhewing unto him my good will, and referring unto him the iſſue and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99333:23"/> ſucceſſe of my deſires and endeavours. And that as well in things which appertain to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and corporall living, as in thoſe things that appertain to the inward and ſpirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This will of God doth ſo much reſtrain me, that although I know that this which I have ſaid, is that which he requires; yet I dare not determine, ſaying, I will do it accordingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I know mine own diſability; but this I do, I continue conſtant in my deſire to conform my ſelf alwayes with this will of God, and to referre to him the iſſue and effect of all my good deſires; and I aſſure my ſelf that God in his mercy ſhall favour me in this good deſigne of mine. And in this manner I ought to govern my ſelf in all things.</p>
               <p>For example, I ſhall find in my ſoul a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deſire to have confidence in God in all things, I will offer up this deſire to God, and humbly commend to him the iſſue and effect thereof. In this manner I deſire to govern my ſelf in Charity, in Hope, in Mortification, in Chriſtian ſimplicity, and in all other things which may make me like unto Chriſt, and like unto God, and in all thoſe things that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the corporall and ſpirituall profit of my neighbours.</p>
               <p>In this manner I wiſh every Chriſtian to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern himſelf, or (to ſpeak better) to ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99333:23"/> to be governed of God; aſſuring him that God will not onely fulfill his deſires, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him with many other things, which though he neither thinks on them, hopes for them, nor deſires them, ſhall be effected by him to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, and to his own edification, and his neighbours. This God ſhall do through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>For confirmation of theſe things which have been ſaid, I conſider that a man <hi>naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines onely of thoſe things which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be in his own power to do, or not to do:</hi> In as much as no man determines to cauſe that it ſhould rain, or be fair weather. Whence I gather, that our determinations ſhall never want arrogancy and preſumption, if we ſhall think that to be in our power, which is no more in our power then to cauſe rain, or to make fair weather. Wherefore we ought not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but <hi>to deſire, and to referre to God the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of that which we deſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Together with this I conſider to the ſame purpoſe, that in our Chriſtian determinations we ought alwayes to conſider, whether that which we determine, be acceptable to God or no: for it is a ſigne of great ignorance to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to do a thing for the honour of God, which thing we are not certain is acceptable to God. And ſo I reſolve my ſelf, that our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſhall then be good and diſcreet, when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99333:24"/> they ſhall be conformable to that which God requires of us, and anſwerable to our ability; for it is a fooliſh thing to promiſe that which is not in the power of him that promiſeth to perform. And this being true, it is well ſaid, that we muſt offer up all our deſires to God, and hold for certain, that he will favour us in them for Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALL of us in acknowledgement of that being which we have from God, are born with obligation to love God, to depend upon him, and to ſuffer our ſelves to be ruled and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him. But this love and duty of ours is not performed by reaſon of our naturall corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and evil inclination, which draws us to the clean contrary. This <hi>obligation</hi> we may call the <hi>law of nature;</hi> and we may ſay that to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this obligation of ours, and this depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the law came, which God by means of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes gave unto the people of the Jews. This evil inclination is ſo powerfull in the minds of men, that how much ſoever they labour in it, they never attain to the full performance of this their obligation.</p>
               <p>God knowing this, ſent his onely begotten Sonne into the world, being made man, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99333:24"/> was pleaſed, that upon him ſhould be executed his juſtice for that which all men had failed, and were to fail, touching the obligation with which we are born. In ſuch manner, that this is the <hi>covenant</hi> between God, and man, <hi>That they ſhould believe, and hold, that that justice, which was executed upon Chriſt the Sonne of God, doth free, and make them exempt from the puniſhment which they ſhould deſerve for that wherein they fail, in regard of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation with which they are born; and that God makes them juſt, holds them for adopted Sons, and as ſuch ruleth and governeth them, in this preſent life, and afterwards raiſeth them up, and ſhall give them eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome is not capable to admit this <hi>covenant.</hi> Firſt, becauſe ſeeing Chriſt to be a man as others are, it cannot be brought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that he is the Sonne of God.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99333:25"/> are hereby aſſured that God doth juſtifie us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>covenant</hi> which he hath made with us, and being juſtified we are incorporated in Chriſt, and planted in him; in ſuch manner, that as an herb is ſuſtained by virtue of the earth where it grows, or is planted; ſo we are ſuſtained by the virtue of Chriſt in whom we are planted, becauſe we perſevere in the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Covenant</hi> two other <hi>Covenants</hi> depend, the one is, that <hi>we believe that Chriſt roſe glorious, and that the belief of this doth incorporate us in the reſurrection of Christ, to the intent that we ſhould riſe as he aroſe, and that God ſhould do unto us that which he did unto Christ.</hi> Humane wiſdome finds not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ground the reſurrection, it believes it not; but the man that hath accepted the <hi>firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> doth eaſily accept this <hi>ſecond.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Covenant</hi> is, <hi>that we believe that Chriſt liveth an everlasting life in a ſoveraign degree with God, and that the beliefe of this gives us eternall life, God doing unto us that which he did, and doth with Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome finds not wherein to ground the hope of this eternall life: but the man who hath by revelation accepted the <hi>firſt Covenant,</hi> and by the firſt hath accepted the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> doth eaſily accept this <hi>third,</hi> ſo that we being aſſured that Chriſt is the ſonne of God,

We believe, <hi>The Christ is the ſonne of God, That he dyed, That he roſe, And that he lives.</hi> And God make us his ſonnes, he juſtifieth us, he raiſeth us up, and he gives us eternall life.</p>

               <p>ALL the good works whereunto we apply our ſelves in this preſent life, do appertain either to the Being a Man, or to the being god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pious.</p>
               <p>The Being of a Man draweth us to have compaſſion one towards another, to help one another, and that, in all thoſe things that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the commodities of this life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Piety</hi> draws us to have confidence in God, to love him, to depend upon him; it draws us to have confidence in Chriſt, to love him, and to preach him; it draws us to mortification of the affections and appetites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are after the fleſh, and it draws us to the deſpiſing of all that which the world doth prize, as honours, ſtates, and riches. Now there may be a man altogether eſtranged from <hi>piety,</hi> who will not onely exerciſe himſelf in all thoſe things, to which the being of a man doth draw him; but alſo in thoſe things that are proper to <hi>piety,</hi> enforcing himſelf alſo to do thoſe things, and he ſhall do ſome of them: And there may be another altogether pious, who ſhall not onely exerciſe himſelf in thoſe things, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to piety, but alſo in thoſe things which are proper to the Being of a man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelf unto them, when they offer

And as the ſtranger to piety exerciſing himſelf in thoſe things, which are properly of piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth not exerciſe himſelf in piety, but in the being of a man, (for his principall intent is his own proper intereſt, which is proper to the being of a man,) ſo on the other ſide, the perſon, that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pious, exerciſing himſelf in thoſe things, which are proper to the Being of a man, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth himſelf in piety, becauſe his principall intent is the glory of God, which is proper to piety. And it comes to paſſe, that one eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from piety, ſhall preach Chriſt, and ſhall not exerciſe himſelf in piety, becauſe his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall intent will be his own glory and intereſt: and on the contrary it comes to paſſe, that a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon will do good to one that is without piety, and he ſhall be exerciſed in piety, becauſe his principall intent is the glory of God: And although he was not moved to that thing with Chriſtian charity, but with humane merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, nevertheleſſe he exerciſed himſelf in piety.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I gather, that the greateſt of all others are thoſe <hi>priviledges,</hi> which they enjoy which have piety, which is obtained by the holy ſpirit, which is communicated to the faithfull by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99333:27"/> knowledge of the difference of works which is here ſet down; ſo alſo is he deprived of the knowledge that he doth never exerciſe himſelf in piety. And that he, who is pious, doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well underſtand, when he exerciſeth himſelf in thoſe things which are proper to a man, and when he exerciſeth himſelf in thoſe things which are properly of piety; and this he doth moſt eaſily, by his due care and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the works that he hath done, and the grounds whereupon he did them. It is true that theſe <hi>priviledges of piety</hi> are in effect Books, which Iſaiah ſaith, <hi>God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> that is, for them that ſhould come to know, and to love him, being juſtified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AMongſt them which have the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, I do conſider two ſorts of men, the one <hi>extremely facil</hi> to believe in matters of Religion all that is told them; and the other <hi>extremely hard.</hi> And as I underſtand it, the <hi>facility</hi> of the one grows from ſuperſtition, and from little conſideration; and the <hi>difficulty</hi> of the other in believing, grows from too much conſideration.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99333:27"/>
               <p>The firſt on no cauſe call humane wiſdome into counſell; and the ſecond call it in all things: and ſo with difficulty they are brought to believe that which humane wiſdome doth not approve.</p>
               <p>The firſt, amongſt ſome true things which they believe, believe many falſe; and it comes to paſſe that they give much more credit to the many falſe, then to the few true: The ſecond, do not believe the falſe, and doubt of the true.</p>
               <p>Conſidering further, I find that the firſt by the ſpirit of God, when it is communicated unto them, are certified of thoſe true things which they believe, by which certification they go by little, and little, freeing themſelves from deceit in falſe things, and ſo they leave them.</p>
               <p>Moreover I find, that the ſecond, by the ſame ſpirit of God, when it is communicated unto them, are certified in the true things, by which certification they fortifie themſelves in believing the true things, and in not believing the falſe things, in ſuch manner, that the holy holy ſpirit entring into two perſons, one very <hi>eaſie to believe,</hi> and the other <hi>very difficult,</hi> it puts them in that eſtate, that the one combates with his own ſelf, labouring to drive out of his mind thoſe falſities, to which with much <hi>faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> he had been perſwaded; and the other combates with himſelf, labouring to certifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99333:28"/> in thoſe true things, which he hath not been able to believe by the relation of men. Both theſe perſons labour, but I hold for better the eſtate of the perſon, that is hard to believe, then of him that is eaſie, and that for three cauſes principally,</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe it is more eaſie to believe the truth, whereunto the holy ſpirit helps, and many other things help, then to unbelieve a lie, which ſuperſtition and many other things hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> becauſe the perſon who is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to believe, may with eaſe be deceived; and he that is hard, ſuffers himſelf hardly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>third,</hi> becauſe the perſon that is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to believe continueth a long time in errour, as they did in the primitive Church, that were converted from Judaiſme to Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And he that is hard, remains free from all falſe opinion, in as much as he onely believes that which the holy ſpirit teacheth him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I reſolve my ſelf, that without any compariſon that eſtate is better, in which the ſpirit of God puts the perſon <hi>hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> when it begins to inſtruct him, then that eſtate in which it puts him who is <hi>eaſie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Together with this, I reſolve my ſelf,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99333:28"/> that that which is believed without the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the ſpirit of God, alwayes conſiſteth more in opinion, then in faith, and is alwayes mingled with falſe and fained things.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it may be underſtood, that when a perſon equally gives credit to all things that are ſaid unto him, he is without the ſpirit of God; he believes by relation, humane perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and by opinion, and not by revelation, nor inſpiration.</p>
               <p>And it being true, that the bleſſedneſſe of a Chriſtian man doth not conſiſt in believing, but in believing by <note n="*" place="margin">He often uſeth this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech, <hi>believing by Revelation,</hi> whereby I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand he meaneth onely the effectuall operation or illumination of the holy ſpirit, teſtifying, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the revealed truth of the Goſpel; and not any private Enthuſiaſmes or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations: as if he ſhould ſay; a generall apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or aſſent to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Goſpel by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, or relation from others, is not that which filleth the heart with joy and peace in believing; but the ſpirits bearing witneſſe with our ſpirit revealing and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the generall promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to every one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, with ſuch ſincerity and efficacy, that it makes him godly, righteous, and ſober all his life long; this I call <hi>believing by Revelation, and not by relation.</hi>

               <p>ALL the Perfections which the holy Scripture attributeth to God; ſeem even according to humane wiſdome, to redound to the benefit of man, except it be one, which ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his damage: foraſmuch as it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall to a man, that God ſhould be omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, liberall, wiſe, faithfull, bountifull, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and pitifull; but it ſeems not beneficiall to him, that he ſhould be <hi>just.</hi> For God being <hi>juſt,</hi> and man unjuſt, he finds not how to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave himſelf in Gods judgement.</p>
               <p>The goodneſſe of God is ſo great, that being willing that this perfection of his, which ſeems to us to redound to the damage of man, ſhould no leſſe redound to his benefit, then all the other; he did determine to execute upon his own Sonne all the rigour of that Juſtice, which he ought to have executed upon all men for all their impieties and ſins, to the intent that men holding this truth for certain, that God hath executed the rigour of his juſtice on his own Sonne, may know that it is as beneficiall to them, that God is <hi>juſt,</hi> as that he is mercifull; it being certain, that adminiſtring <hi>Juſtice</hi> he cannot fail to ſave them, they having accepted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99333:29"/> for their own, that <hi>Justice</hi> which was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his own Sonne.</p>
               <p>Whereby I underſtand and aſſure my ſelf, that God revealed unto the Saints of the old Teſtament, That his juſtice ought to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon his own Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and therefore they might certainly hold, that it was no leſſe favourable for them, that God ſhould be juſt, then mercifull; together with all the other perfections, that are attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>

               <p>From this fear ſuperſtititions grow, ſcruples grow, and ceremonies grow: From all which we are free, that are come by revelation unto the knowledge of Chriſt, being certain that God being juſt, he will not twice puniſh.</p>

                  <p>How the reaſon of our inward man ſerves us to that, which the eyes of our outward man do.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving often ſaid, that to be and perſevere in the kingdome of God, it is needfull for a man to mortifie in all things and altogether his reaſon, and his humane prudence; it is doubted, this being true, to what purpoſe God put <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in a man, ſince he will not have him to ſerve himſelf therewith whileſt he abides in his kingdome. To this it ſeems to me that I may anſwer reſolutely, that God put <hi>reaſon</hi> in the <hi>inner man,</hi> to that end for which he put the <hi>eyes</hi> in the <hi>outward man.</hi> For as much as the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eyes</hi> are able to ſee the Sun, not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but with the ſelf ſame Sun, and likewiſe all thoſe things which the Sun diſcovereth: ſo the <hi>reaſon</hi> which is in the <hi>inward man,</hi> is able to know God, not of it ſelf, but with the ſelf ſame God, and likewiſe all thoſe things which God manifeſteth.</p>
               <p>The firſt man priding himſelf of his <hi>reaſon,</hi> would know God without God, as if one would ſee the Sun without the Sun; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived himſelf of the knowledge of God, and was left to the government of his own reaſon. And he and all they that have imitated him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to know God with their own <hi>reaſon,</hi> or by their own underſtanding of the Scriptures,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99333:30"/> and by contemplation of the creatures, are more raſh then they who being unwilling to ſee the Sun with the Sun, ſhould endeavour to ſee it with the light of candles.</p>
               <p>Now this being true, we may underſtand that God hath put <hi>reaſon</hi> in man, to the end that with it he might know God, but with God, and not by his own diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>It is meet that God ſhould require of man that he mortifie his own <hi>reaſon,</hi> in as much as it preſumes to know God, and the things of God by it ſelf alone, without the ſpirit of God; if ſo be he deſire to know God, and to abide in the kingdome of God in ſuch manner as he ought.</p>
               <p>Of this mortification we have already at other times ſpoken, and ſaid that it is that which Jeſus Chriſt our Lord diſcovereth unto us.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Certain great Kings Vaſſals rebelled againſt him, for their rebellion he condemned them to death, deprived them of their goods, drove them out of his kingdome; being condemned, deprived, and driven out, they ſet themſelves to ſerve other kings, ſtrangers, and enemies to their naturall King.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:99333:31"/>
               <p>Things ſtanding thus for ſome ſpace of time, the King that was benigne toward his vaſſalls, deſiring to reduce unto his kingdome thoſe that went wandring, and baniſhed, firſt of all he executed the rigour of his juſtice upon his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne, and afterward he ſent to make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick proclamation throughout the whole world, in the which he declared, that his juſtice was already ſatisfied, and that he generally pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all thoſe that had rebelled againſt him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to return unto his kingdome, and promiſing unto them entire reſtitution of that which they had loſt.</p>
               <p>They which were culpable in the rebellion heard this proclamation, of which ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that they had not run thereinto, would not accept the pardon; it ſeeming unto them that accepting it they ſhould make themſelves to have been rebels: Others, although they knew themſelves rebels, would not give credit to the proclamation, it ſeeming to them too ſtrange a thing, that the King ſhould pardon them, becauſe his Sonne had been obedient to him. Likewiſe ſome others, although they knew themſelves rebels, although they held the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation for certain, although they took co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of it, and they themſelves publiſhed it, notwithſtanding all this, they dared not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the kingdome, but rather by all wayes &amp; means poſſible to them, they beſtirred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99333:31"/> to obtain pardon of the King with ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, gifts, and preſents; by no means willing to enjoy the Kings liberality, or the obedience of the Kings Son: And ſo not coming to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, their eſtates were not reſtored unto them, and ſo neither theſe nor thoſe other enjoyed the generall pardon; in ſuch ſort that as much as belonged to them, it was no more then if it had never been made. There were ſome others, who knowing themſelves rebels, and giving entire credit to the proclamation, having confidence in the Kings word, accepted the pardon generall, and came unto the kingdome, ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all things, and altogether unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of their own King. And although at the beginning they doubted ſomewhat of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſo much the more, as they ſaw that their eſtates were not preſently reſtored unto them; notwithſtanding, they reſolving not to depart from the kingdome, and ſeeing that the King uſed them well, and that by little and little, he went on reſtoring unto them that which they had loſt by their rebellion; they likewiſe went on, certifying themſelves to have obtained the pardon, and found themſelves moſt contented in having come to ſerve their own King, and to abide under his regiment and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they had proved the evil of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and of baniſhment, they did deprive
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99333:32"/> and diſpoyl themſelves of all friendſhip, and of all intelligences with men, and of all their own proper deſignes, which according to their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might make them another time rebels. In this they employed and exerciſed themſelves; whereupon by little and little they gained ſo much credit with the King, that not onely he reſtored unto them all that which they had loſt by their rebellion, but he gave them many great gifts, and he uſed them in that manner, as if ſo be they had never been rebels.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Compariſon:</hi> and although it be of it ſelf clear, I will not ceaſe to declare it a little better, and ſay, That the firſt man being in the kingdome of God, created to the <hi>image</hi> and <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of God, rebelled againſt God, for which rebellion he was deprived of this <hi>image</hi> and <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of God, he was driven out of the kingdome of God, and he was condemned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death; and in this baniſhment all mankind abode, ſerving the devil a long while.</p>
               <p>God willing of his infinite mercy to remedy this evil, firſt of all executed the rigour of his juſtice upon his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; and afterward ſent to preach throughout all the world, how that now his juſtice was ſatisfied, and how that he had now pardoned all them that were rebels, and that they might at their pleaſures return unto the kingdome, out of which they were driven, and that he would reſtore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99333:32"/> them his own image and likeneſſe, which they had loſt. This Proclamation hath been heard throughout the whole world. And of mankind ſome holding themſelves Saints and juſt, have imagined that the pardon belongs not to them; it ſeeming to them, that where there is no errour there needs no pardon; and ſo they have let it paſſe. Others, although they hold themſelves for rebels, yet truſt not to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, it ſeeming to them a thing too too ſtrange, that God ſhould pardon them and receive them into his kingdome, and reſtore unto them that which they had loſt by rebellion, for anothers juſtice and obedience.</p>
               <p>There are others, who albeit they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rebels, and although they hold the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for certain, and embrace the Goſpel, and read it, and preach it; yet for all this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring themſelves to enter into the kingdome of God, becauſe they have more confidence in themſelves then in God; and ſo they will rather ſtay under the government of their humane prudence, then come unto the kingdome of God. Theſe think they ought to gain the pardon of their rebellion with their induſtry, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and with their merits. And becauſe as well they as thoſe others, come not to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, they feel not the benefit thereof, nor enjoy the liberality of God, nor the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt. And unto this eſtate they are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99333:33"/> brought through their own arrogancy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and ſo by this means continue alwaies in their rebellion. There are others who know themſelves rebels to God, and do give entire faith and credit unto the pardon generall, which is preached unto them on Gods behalf in the Goſpel, and ſo inſtantly without further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking accepting the pardon, they come unto the kingdome of God, renouncing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, and the government of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence. And albeit theſe at firſt may ſeem to make ſome kind of doubt, doubt of the pardon, doubt of the government and regiment of God; yet in as much as they depart not from the kingdome, they go on certifying themſelves both in the one and the other of theſe matters; and ſo much the more, as they feel that God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in reſtoring unto them that image and likeneſſe of God, which the firſt man loſt by his rebellion, with all thoſe other priviledges which were loſt by the ſame rebellion.</p>
               <p>And becauſe the principall puniſhment of the rebellion was death, albeit he do not deliver them from temporall death, for they die as well as others; yet he delivers them from eternall death, promiſing them the reſurrection, and giving them a ſignall thereof, by the inward vivification and by the reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And theſe men live in the height of chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, attending onely to mortifie their wiſdome,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99333:33"/> and their humane reaſon, and all thoſe other things that led them to their fore-paſſed rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which might lead them on to the like. In this they abide, in this they perſevere, and ſo they go getting ſo much favour of God, that he doth not onely cauſe them to feel the pardon, and that happineſſe which is to be in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to poſſeſſe the image of God in it; but he doth many other graces and favours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, accepting them for his ſonnes.</p>
               <p>This kingdome begins in this preſent life, and is continued in that which is to come. And all this felicity thoſe perſons do acknowledge from the liberality of God, from the obedience of his onely begotten Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>HAving ſet my ſelf ſometimes to conſider, with how great difficulty mans mind is brought to believe as it ought the things of Chriſtian piety, when it ſets it ſelf to view and review them; I am come to examine amongſt all theſe, what that is in which there is greateſt difficulty found.

               <p>In as much therefore as it being true, that amongſt all thoſe things which are believed in <hi>Chriſtian piety,</hi> onely this <hi>Generall pardon,</hi> as it is ſaid, might redound unto the damage of him that believeth it, in caſe it ſhould not be true, it ſeemeth to me that my reſolution is good, That amongſt the things which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, this is that which is believed with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt difficultie. I might fortifie this my reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with many reaſons; but this ſeems to be ſo clear, that I will content my ſelf therewith; proving it with that which is ſeen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that even he who gives credence to the Proclamation which is publiſhed through the world concerning the <hi>Pardon generall,</hi> and ſhews that he doth believe it, by renouncing all outward juſtification, and by entring into the kingdome of God (in which God equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides for his, both of things that appertain to the body and the ſoul;) nevertheleſſe even he finds much repugnancie in his mind, when he will reduce it to thoſe terms, that he ſhould to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hope from God the ſuſtentation of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99333:34"/> and of the ſoul, in as much as he alwayes goes thinking, and ſaying in himſelf, How if it ſhould not be true, that God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide things neceſſary for my ſuſtentation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mine own ſolicitouſneſſe, what ſhall become of me? And again, How if it be not true, that God hath executed upon Chriſt the rigour of his juſtice, and that by his order the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pardon generall</hi> be publiſhed through the world? if theſe things be not true, I ſhall remain miſerably abuſed. And it is certain, that ſo much more any perſon makes theſe diſcourſes, by how much it ſeems to him that he might of himſelf provide both for the one, and the other.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on further, and willing to examine whether with greater difficultie a man brings himſelf to hope from God, either the ſuſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his body, or that of his mind, I ſuppoſe it is the ſuſtentation of the body. This I ſuppoſe to be ſo, in regard that a man brings himſelf with leſſe difficulty to expect from God that which he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knows he cannot be able to obtain of himſelf: It being therefore true, that a man doth more diſtruſt himſelf touching his juſtification, then his ſuſtentation, it is concluded, that there is greater difficulty to bring a mans ſelf to hope for his corporall, then his ſpirituall ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Having gone thus farre with my conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I well underſtand what the cauſe is, that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99333:35"/> rich man enters with difficulty into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. And willing to perſwade my mind, that it ſhould bring it ſelf to depend on God, as well in corporall, as in ſpirituall things, I call to remembrance, how Chriſt doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe them for vantage to thoſe, who ſeek the kingdome of God. And I ſuppoſe, that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that which Chriſt promiſeth in things pertaining to the ſoul, to be true, I have no cauſe to doubt, but I ſhould find him true like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in thoſe things, which appertain to the body.</p>
               <p>When this doth not ſuffice me, I think in this manner; Since that I am juſtified in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving accepted and believed the Proclamation of the <hi>Pardon generall,</hi> and ſince that I am entred into the kingdome of God, from which the firſt man was driven by rebellion, and that I go on recovering the priviledges which the firſt man loſt by his rebellion; ought I to doubt, that God without my ſolicitouſneſſe will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for me in outward things? ſince it is true that the firſt man, as long as he remained in the kingdome of God, was provided of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own ſolicitouſneſſe: And that this is true I know from hence, that among other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, with which God puniſhed his rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, this was one, <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes ſhalt thou eat thy bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all theſe Conſiderations I gather, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99333:35"/> it becomes me to attend with my mind to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on God, as well in the ſuſtentation of the body, as in that of the mind. And ſo much more in the ſuſtentation of the body, now I have accepted and believed the proclamation of the <hi>Pardon generall,</hi> and am entred into the kingdome of God: for I know it is true, that with greater difficultie a man brings himſelf to truſt in this matter, then in that other.</p>
               <p>Together with this I gather, that I ſhall then be entirely a citizen of the kingdome of God, when I ſhall depend altogether on God, being a lively and true member of the ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How Chriſtians ought to govern themſelves in their tribulations, afflictions, and troubles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEcauſe humane wiſdome, as we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, thinks that it is humility not to have confidence in God, and that it is pride to have confidence in him; it is neceſſary that a Chriſtian ſhould alwayes ſtand upon his guard touching this point, ſo that he be not deceived in taking the one for the other.</p>
               <p>When a pious perſon finds himſelf in ſome great trouble and diſtreſſe, he is tempted by the Divel, through the means of humane wiſdome, perſwading him that it is amiſſe to belieue that God ſhall deliver him from that diſtreſſe and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99333:36"/> trouble in which he finds himſelf; and tells him that that which appertains to him, is onely to bring his mind to be content with that which God will do concerning him.</p>
               <p>This perſwaſion ſeems pious and holy, but being examined with a Chriſtian ſpirit, a man may know in it a certain ſpice of deſperation, and diffidence; which conſiſteth in that firſt part, where it is ſaid, that it is amiſſe to have confidence in God. And although the ſecond part with the deſire of reducing the mind to ſubmit it ſelf to God, be good, yet it is marred by the firſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the intent that the ſecond may be good, the Chriſtian ſpirit makes the firſt good thus: it perſwades every pious perſon when it ſees him in diſtreſſe and trouble, that God hath promiſed that he will make account of them, that make account of him, and that he will not ſuffer them to be evil intreated of worldly perſons, nay more, he will have great care of them, and will help them, and defend them.</p>
               <p>Thou makeſt account of God, hold then for certain and firm, that God makes account of thee, and that by and by he will draw thee from this diſtreſſe and trouble, in which thou findeſt thy ſelf, in ſuch ſort as the wicked who ſeek thy harm, ſhall have no cauſe to rejoyce at thy harm.</p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:99333:36"/>
               <p>The holy Spirit ſpeaking to him theſe words, it brings to his memory all the promiſes that God in holy Scripture makes, pertaining hereunto. And when the pious perſon that is in tribulation, is made capable of this truth, and ſtands firm and conſtant in this hope, then it perſwades him to reduce his mind to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which God will do with him in that tribulation. And in ſuch caſe this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the will of God is pious, and holy, becauſe it is founded upon confidence, which is a pious and holy foundation.</p>
               <p>To this humane wiſdome oppoſeth it ſelf, and ſayes, <hi>Thou having ſeen that God permits, that his ſhould be perſecuted, afflicted, and evil intreated, in what canſt thou found thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he will free thee from this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and trouble? In what I ſay, O Christian, canſt thou found this confidence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this the Chriſtian ſpirit replies, It is true, that God permits all that you ſay to befall them which are his, when it is for the cauſe of the Goſpel, for the manifeſtation of his own glory, for the illuſtration of his own name, and not for the malignity and appetite of the men of this world; God indeed permits that his Saints ſhall be evil intreated becauſe they be Saints; for from hence redound all that which we have ſpoken of. But he doth not permit it, when they are evil intreated as men, for the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99333:37"/> things of the world. For he hath promiſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the contrary.</p>
               <p>David glories, <hi>That he had not ſeen in all his life any juſt man forſaken of God:</hi> And in this may all juſt men glory: for albeit God permits that they ſhould ſuffer, when they ſuffer becauſe they be Saints and juſt men; yet he doth not permit that they ſhould ſuffer for thoſe things which indifferently befall to men in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life.</p>
               <p>From all this which is ſpoken, it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that a Chriſtian when he is evil intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his piety and juſtice, rejoycing that in it and by it the name of God is glorified, he ought to ſubmit himſelf wholly and altogether to God, reducing his mind to content it ſelf with that which God ſhall ordain, and diſpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him: and when he is evil intreated as a perſon of the world, he ought to believe and be aſſured that God will draw him out of that affliction and trouble, with much ſatisfaction and content; reducing his mind alſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that which God will do.</p>
               <p>And this truly is a Chriſtian diſpoſition of the ſoul, which is onely found in them that ſtand incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>CHriſtian piety requires that a Chriſtian man ſhould hold certainly and firmly that God will maintain him in this preſent life with his grace, and in his grace; and that in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life he will give him immortality and glory.</p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome preſuming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or pretending piety, perſwades him that he ought to hold for certain that God will deal thus with him, but on condition that he have Faith, Hope, and Charity, which are the gifts of God that give life and being to a Chriſtian. And in the mean while humane wiſdome underſtands not, that a man ſhall ſo farre enjoy theſe three gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he ſhall abide certainly and firmly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thoſe other two things, wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian piety requires that a Chriſtian man ſhould abide firm, and aſſure himſelf in. For in theſe two things doth Faith and Hope conſiſt, from which Charity doth ariſe and proceed.</p>
               <p>Whence it is well gathered, that it belongs to a Chriſtian to ſhut his ears to humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to open them to the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the holy ſpirit; and ſo to attend to certifie and ſtabliſh himſelf in thoſe two firſt things. And he ſhall then obtain and poſſeſſe theſe three
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99333:38"/> Chriſtian gifts of Faith, Hope, and Charity, when he ſhall certainly and firmly believe that God will maintain him in this preſent life with his grace, and in his grace; and that in the other life he will give him immortality and glory.</p>
               <p>I know, will the pious Chriſtian ſay, that God calls unto him onely thoſe <hi>whom he hath firſt known</hi> and predeſtinated: I know alſo, that <hi>thoſe whom he calls, them he juſtifies and them he glorifies.</hi> And I know certainly that he hath called me, and thereby I aſſure my ſelf that he hath known and predeſtinated me, and that he hath juſtified me, and he will glorifie me. In this let him ſtand, in this let him confirm himſelf without doubting in any manner: for the <hi>promiſes of God</hi> are fulfilled with them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that believe them.</p>
               <p>That this is true, may be proved by many authorities of holy Scripture. But better it is to ſay, That the truth of this matter is not believed, except it be in ſome meaſure experimented; and the experience appertains only to them that ſtand incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>In what manner a Man ought to reſolve himſelf touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, and touching himſelf, that he may become a true Christian.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL the Chriſtian buſineſſe conſiſts in truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, believing, and loving: for all this is piety, juſtice, and holineſſe; forasmuch as a man having confidence, gets piety; believing, gets juſtice; and loving, holineſſe.</p>
               <p>That a man may truſt, believe, and love, it is neceſſary to apprehend, to underſtand, and know: To apprehend, in what thing he ought to have confidence, To underſtand in what it is convenient to believe, And to know that which ought to be loved. Of this wiſdome, knowledge, and intelligence, a man is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, partly for the depravation that is naturall to him by reaſon of Originall ſinne, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by reaſon of that which is acquired by evil cuſtome, and worſe exerciſes.</p>
               <p>The Wiſe man meant this, when he ſaid, <hi>That wiſdome entreth not into a mind that is evil inclined, nor abideth in a body ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon I underſtand, that a man which deſireth to truſt, believe, and love, that he may obtain piety, juſtice, and holineſſe; to ſuch an one it appertains to be wiſe, to know, and to underſtand; deſpoyling his mind of all evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and eſtranging his body from all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99333:39"/> evil exerciſes, and from evil cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Together with this I underſtand, that to the intent a man may diſpoil his mind of every evil inclination, it is meet that a man ſhould coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and generouſly reſolve himſelf touching the world, turning his back to all the honour, glory, and eſtimation thereof, not pretending unto it, not procuring it, nor deſiring it in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, nor in any manner, putting an end to all kinds of ambition, and ſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem.</p>
               <p>Together with this I underſtand, that to the intent a man may eſtrange his body from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil exerciſes, and from all evil cuſtomes, it is meet that a man ſhould valourouſly reſolve touching things which concern himſelf, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in good earneſt all thoſe things, from which there doth come, or may come any carnall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, or corporall content; putting an end to all, eſtranging himſelf from it, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring it. For doing thus he ſhall purifie his ſoul, and body, and ſhall make himſelf able, (God giving unto him that wiſdome, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and knowledge, which he is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of) to obtain Confidence, Faith, and Love, and ſhall be Pious, Juſt, and Holy, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he ſhall become a true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Unto this reſolution I underſtand that Jeſus Chriſt our Lord inviteth every one of us, ſaying, <hi>He that will come after me, let
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99333:39"/> him deny himſelf,</hi> or <hi>forſake all, and take up his croſſe:</hi> and then a man is ſaid to <hi>take his croſſe</hi> upon him, when willingly he ſuffers the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome with which the men of the world will martyrize him, whether it be of the body, or of the ſoul. That of the body the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Primitive Church did ſuffer, when thoſe which were open enemies of God and of Chriſt, took away their lives becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Chriſt. That of the mind hath been ſuffered, and is daily to be ſuffered by true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that have followed the ſteps of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, when they who are ſecret enemies of God and of Chriſt, do deſpiſe them, eſteem them for vile, and for no body, deprive them of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and fame. And as I underſtand it, this is the moſt cruell, and moſt terrible, and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable martyrdome of all: And a man that ſtands conſtant in this kind of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, may well hold himſelf for a true martyr of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Together with this I underſtand, that to the reſolutions which a man ſhould make with the world, and with his own ſelf; and to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome whereunto he ought to be ready, Chriſt added, <hi>And let him follow me,</hi> I conceive a man doth not obtain piety, juſtice, and holineſſe through the reſolution, nor through the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, but through the imitation of Chriſt, in as much as imitating Chriſt, he goes recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99333:40"/> in his mind the image and ſimilitude of God, with which the firſt man was created, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving to recover it alſo in his body in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the juſt, where having obtained impaſſibility and immortality, the Chriſtian ſhall perpetually rejoyce with Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>UNderſtanding that which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that none can come unto him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his eternall Father draws him:</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>all men have not faith,</hi> and that <hi>Faith is the gift of God;</hi> I underſtand likewiſe that it is not in any mans power to believe, to love, and to have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Neither is it in a mans power to know God, nor to know himſelf, nor to hate the world and himſelf: Forasmuch as all this muſt come unto him by particular and eſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; in ſuch ſort, that as it ſeems here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is not in mans power to form and frame his mind, ſo that he ſhould become pious, juſt, and holy; for all this muſt come unto him from God. On the other ſide I perceive many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and Admonitions, of which the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture is full, by which generally men are
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99333:40"/> exhorted and inſtructed unto piety, juſtice, and holineſſe. I conceive, that it appertains to every man to deſire and procure pietie, juſtice, and holineſſe, but it muſt be by praying and ſeeking them of God; for from him onely, and by this means onely, they are procured and obtained. And as I underſtand, it appertains to that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man that exerciſes himſelf in deſiring and demanding this, to exerciſe himſelf with all ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and diligence in thoſe things which belong to him, and which ſeem to be in his own power to do; that is, in refraining the affections, and the appetites, at leaſt in outward things, in which they may be reſtrained; that is to ſay, not to ſee that which would give ſatisfaction to thine eyes, and not to heare than which delights thy ears, and ſo in all other outward ſenſes, in which a Chriſtian may overcome himſelf, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his body, when he cannot ſeparate his mind</p>
               <p>But above all things a Chriſtian man ought to attend principally not to content the men of this world, neither to walk, nor to ſpeak after the reliſh of their words; evermore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ſaying of S. Paul, <hi>If I ſeek to pleaſe men, I am not the ſervant of God.</hi> In which matter he ought obſerve this rule; If ſo be he be ſolicited to pleaſe men in things contrary unto piety, he ſhall in no wiſe pleaſe them: if in things conformable to piety, alwayes: And if in indifferent things, he ſhall pleaſe them in
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99333:41"/> thoſe things in which he diſpleaſeth himſelf, and he ſhall not pleaſe them in thoſe things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he finds his own proper ſatisfaction. In ſuch manner, that then he ſhall bring himſelf not to pleaſe men, when they deſire of him things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to piety, and when he ſhall have in thoſe things which they deſire, his own proper ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. And in this manner he ſhall not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſatisfie them, becauſe he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them, but becauſe he would not offend pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and becauſe he would not give nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his mind touching its own ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>To this paſſe a man ſhall eaſily bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, recommending himſelf to God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes living with watch over himſelf, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he lives amongſt more then mortall enemies, amongſt which it becomes him to ſtand alwayes on his guard, that nothing may happen unto him unawares. Now a Chriſtian man exerciſing himſelf as I have ſaid, muſt not think hereby to get piety, juſtice, and holineſſe; but he ſhall onely keep his mind very wakefull, and his manners well moderated; to the intent that when it ſhall pleaſe God to give unto him piety, juſtice, and holineſſe, they may fall into his ſoul ſo happily and proſperouſly, as water falls on good ground, when it is plowed and cleared from thorns and ſtones. Holding this for certain, that as the Tiller when he clears his ground from thorns and ſtones, doth no way
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99333:41"/> oblige God that he ſhould ſend his rain and his ſunne upon it; ſo neither doth a man by purging and cleanſing the appetites of his body, and the affections of his mind, oblige God that he ſhould ſend his holy Spirit to him. But as the ſunne and the rain do more good to the earth which it finds plowed and purged from thorns and ſtones; ſo in like manner the holy Spirit doth more good to the mind which he findeth free and purged from all worldly affections, and all carnall appetites. And after this manner the Chriſtian man underſtanding that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him, and exerciſing himſelf therein, and underſtanding what he is to expect from God, and deſiring it, and waiting for it, in ſhort time ſhall find himſelf much conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the image of God, and unto that of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>I conſider, that it belongs to a Chriſtian, to the intent that he may ſatisfie the name which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99333:44"/> he holds, &amp; obſerve the profeſſion which he hath made in his Baptiſme, to reduce himſelf to that reſolution to which men in the beginning of the manifeſtation of the Goſpel did reduce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, every man ſaying after this manner: I am dead and buried as much as belongs to the world; for when they baptized me, they ſlew me, and buried me: and I am raiſed up, and <hi>live towards God;</hi> for when Chriſt died, I was buried in Baptiſme with Chriſt in his death, and I began to riſe, and to live with Chriſt in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and in his life. God killing the fleſh of Chriſt on the Croſſe, killed mine; and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up Chriſt, raiſed up me. Now it being true, that I am dead and buried, it is neceſſary, that in me there be no greater livelineſſe of worldly affections, and carnall appetites, then in a man, who truely and effectually is <hi>dead</hi> and buried. And it being likewiſe true, that I am raiſed up with Chriſt and alive unto God, it is needfull that all thoſe affections and deſires ſhould be alive in me, which are in a man who is truely and effectually raiſed up. He that lives with this determination and reſolution, will live on his guard, and be watchfull; in ſuch ſort, that when he ſhall know in himſelf any affection, or any appetite which belongs to a man that lives to the vvorld, ſtraightvvay he vvill labour to kill it, ſaying, this belongs not to me vvho am <hi>dead to the world.</hi> And vvhen he ſhall find himſelf
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99333:44"/> ſolicited by any thing that is matter of honour, and of vvorldly eſteem; or vvhen he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf, becauſe the one, or the other is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, he vvill quickly provide remedy for the evil, ſaying, I knovv I <hi>live</hi> not unto the <hi>world;</hi> vvhy then I ought not to pretend unto, or to eſteem that vvhich the vvorld eſteems; and if I <hi>live unto God,</hi> I ought not to pretend unto, nor to eſteem but onely that vvhich God pretends unto, and eſteems; that is, that I ſhould eſteem my ſelf <hi>dead</hi> and buried in reſpect of the vvorld, and that I ſhould eſteem my ſelf raiſed up, and <hi>alive unto God;</hi> in ſuch ſort, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>dead,</hi> and buried <hi>unto the world,</hi> ought not to pretend unto the things of the vvorld, nor I ought not to reſent my ſelf, vvhen I am depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them; and being raiſed up by God and living unto God, I ought to pretend unto the things of God, and to be grieved and to reſent my ſelf, vvhen I ſhall be deprived of them. And the things of God, vvhich a Chriſtian ought to pretend unto, are the gifts and graces of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, that may rule and govern him, and vvhich may maintain him in the poſſeſſion of the kingdome of God in this preſent life, as much as may be, and in eternall life, as it ought to be; and this by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>IN the Infirmity, Amendment,</hi> and <hi>Health of the mind,</hi> I conceive, that thoſe men which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the kingdome of God, ought to govern themſelves, as diſcreet men govern themſelves in the <hi>Infirmities, Amendment, and Health of the body.</hi> That which I would ſay, is, that as the diſcreet perſon that is ſick in his body, ſeeks diſcreet and experienced Phyſicians, who by applying unto him convenient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and giving him rules and directions do cure him: Even ſo he that finds himſelf ſick in his mind, ought to ſeek a ſpirituall and experimented Phyſician, or Phyſicians, that may ſet him in the way of the knowledge of Chriſt, that ſo becoming the member of Chriſt, he may be healed of the <hi>Infirmity of his ſoul,</hi> of which I underſtand all thoſe are healed, who being called of God do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt: all others remain in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</p>

               <p>Furthermore I ſay, that as he who having been ſick, and upon recovery, although he find himſelf well, if he be a diſcreet man, yet doth not ſuffer himſelf to be tranſported to eat things contrary to his health, nor to do any damagea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſes, although he do not live with that attention, with which he lived when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on recovery, being afraid to return unto the ſickneſſe of which he was cured; ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he that finds himſelf healed of the infirmity of his mind, feeling himſelf much mortified, and much quickned, ought not to live negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               </argument>
               <p>ALL men that ſin, ſinne either againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or againſt their neighbours, or againſt Chriſt, or againſt God. They ſinne againſt themſelves, which defile their bodies with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vices, and with drunkenneſſe, and deprave their minds with ambition, envie, and wrath: for whileſt they occupy themſelves in theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the naturall depravation with which they are born, they adde corruption to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They ſinne againſt their neighbours, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them evil and damage in their perſons, in their eſtate, in their honour and fame, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them evil example, and evil doctrine. They
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:99333:46"/> ſinne againſt Chriſt, juſtifying themſelves by their own works: for thereby they ſhew that they give no credit to Chriſt, touching the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Juſtification, which covenant he made between God and man by ſhedding his bloud. I ſay, they declare that they do not hold it for a thing firmly eſtabliſhed, and that they do not rely upon it. They ſinne againſt God, when they reſent themſelves, and are grieved touching that which God doth: For in grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, reſenting, and afflicting themſelves, they ſhew that they do not content themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And this diſcontent of men proceeds from this, that they eſteem it not good, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming it not to be good proceeds from this, that they have not a good opinion of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ground they grow in the end even to hate God.</p>
               <p>Now they who ſinne againſt themſelves, ſinne againſt the dignity of a man: they who ſinne againſt their neighbour, ſinne againſt charity: they who ſinne againſt Chriſt, ſinne againſt the faith: and they who ſinne againſt God, ſinne againſt naturall piety.</p>
               <p>They who ſinne againſt themſelves, ſinne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo againſt their neighbours, inaſmuch as by their ſinnes they give evil example; and they ſinne againſt Chriſt, inaſmuch as by their ſinnes they make Chriſtian Religion to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpoken of; they ſinne againſt God, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99333:47"/> as they are convinced in themſelves either by the Law, or by their own judgements, that they offend God in that which they do.</p>
               <p>They who ſinne againſt their neighbours, ſinne likewiſe againſt themſelves, augmenting their proper depravation and corruption: they ſinne againſt Chriſt, depriving themſelves of Charity, which is the proper counter-ſigne of Chriſtian Piety; and they ſinne againſt God, being convinced in themſelves, either through the Law, or through their own conſciences, that they offend God in that which they do.</p>
               <p>They who ſinne againſt Chriſt, ſinne againſt themſelves, depriving themſelves of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently of the kingdome of God; they ſinne againſt their neighbours, in giving them examples of incredulity; and they ſinne againſt God; for in offending the Sonne, they offend the Father, and offending him that is ſent, they offend him that ſent.</p>
               <p>They who ſinne againſt God, ſinne againſt themſelves, depriving themſelves of pietie; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their neighbours, by giving them evil example; againſt Chriſt, for the ſame reſpect that they do who ſinne againſt Chriſt; they ſinne againſt God, for the union which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and God.</p>
               <p>From hence I gather, that a man owes to himſelf puritie and cleanneſſe, which is got by mortification of the appetites and affections,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:99333:47"/> which are according to the old Adam. He ows unto his neighbours Love and Charity, with good example, and good doctrine; To Chriſt, faith; and to God, piety.</p>
               <p>And I underſtand, that as unto faith there is alſo annexed certain hope of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and life eternall; ſo unto piety is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the worſhip in ſpirit and in truth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I gather, that to live licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and vitiouſly, is a ſigne of depravation and corruption: To live hurtfull to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is a ſigne of malignity and iniquity: To live ſuperſtitiouſly and ceremoniouſly, is a ſigne of incredulity and diffidence: To live diſcontent for that which God doth, is a ſigne of impiety: as on the contrary, to live chaſt, and pure, and modeſt, is a ſigne of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: To live without prejudicing any one, is a ſigne of charitie and goodneſſe: To live with peace of conſcience, is a ſigne of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and confidence: To live contentedly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing which God doth, is a ſigne of piety and holineſſe. Whereupon I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, as mortification and charitie are got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten onely by Gods gift; ſo likewiſe faith, and confidence, piety, and holineſſe, morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and charitie are continued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in a man by the Spirit of God, even that which is obtained through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:99333:48"/>
               <p>I will adde this further, that in thoſe things wherein men ſinne againſt themſelves, and againſt their neighbours, if ſo be they ſinne through weakneſſe and infirmity, preſently after they have ſinned, they are ſory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, conſidering the offence of God, and the hurt of their neighbour, and of themſelves. And in thoſe things wherein men ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, and againſt God, if they ſinne through weakneſſe and infirmity, they do the ſame, conſidering the offence of Chriſt, and of God, the ill example of their neighbour, and their own damage.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, as they that ſinne in carnal vices, find ſatisfaction in their ſinnes, when they ſinne through wretched wilfulneſſe; ſo alſo they who ſinne againſt Chriſt in outward juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and againſt God, being grieved at thoſe things which God doth, if ſo be they ſinne through incredulity and impiety, they find ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in their own works, and in their own opinions.</p>
               <p>And by theſe counter-ſignes may a man know when he ſinnes through frailty and infirmity, and when through wretched wilfulneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity; alwayes ſetting before his eyes the light of the Spirit, which is obtained through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>For what reaſon God ſometime gives a godly man a Child, and ſoon after takes him away.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EXamining with my ſelf what God intends, when he beſtowes upon a godly perſon a child, and a few dayes after takes him away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; I ſuppoſe he intends that which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, when we give an infant a thing, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him much delighted therewith, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to make experiment of his mind and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we take it away again. And as we like well that child whom we ſee with the ſame chearfulneſſe to part with the thing, when we take it from him, with which he took it, and diſlike him when we ſee him ſorrowfull and ſtubborn; ſo God willing to make proof of a pious perſon, and of his mortification, gives him a ſonne, and when he ſees him joyfull, takes him from him; and if he leave his ſon, when God takes him away, with the ſame contentedneſſe with which he received him when God gave him, he gives good ſigne of his piety, and holineſſe; but if he be ſorrowfull, grieved, and weeps, he gives an ill ſigne of his piety, and a worſe of his mortification.</p>
               <p>One difference there is, that we giving the thing to the child, and taking it away, intend to prove and know him; and God in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſonne upon a pious perſon, and taking
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99333:49"/> him away, intends that the ſaid perſon ſhould know himſelf, and underſtand how farre he is proceeded in piety, and in mortification; and he intends to exerciſe him in mortification. And it is a much more eaſie thing to God to give a ſonne to a man, and to take him away, then for a man to give a Pear, and take it away.</p>
               <p>Herewith I underſtand, that every pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to demean himſelf towards God, when he deprives him of any thing which he hath given him, how dear ſoever it be unto him, as a well inclined child demeans himſelf towards his father, when he takes from him the thing which he had given him.

               </argument>
               <p>FInding my ſoul altogether barren and dry, and as it were eſtranged from God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that this was becauſe God had hid his preſence from me; I thought to relieve and comfort my ſelf in this my neceſſity by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing my memory, that it ſhould not think upon any other thing but God. Scarce had I made this deliberation, and begun to put it in execution,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99333:49"/> but I perceived that although it be in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to exerciſe my memory in God, as in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other thing; yet for all that it is not in my power to make that my mind ſhould feel the preſence of God, and ſo free it ſelf from its barrenneſſe, and dryneſſe, and eſtrangement from God. Furthermore, I underſtood a very great difference between the ſtate in which the ſoul that labours to have God preſent, finds it ſelf, from the eſtate in which it finds it ſelf, when God cauſeth it to feel his preſence. And being willing to know in what this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiſteth, I underſtood it conſiſted in this, that in one eſtate mans ſpirit worketh, and in the other, the holy Spirit worketh. And ſo I reſolved with my ſelf, that between theſe ſtates, there is the ſame difference, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fleſh and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on further I underſtood, that thoſe men who upon their own deſignes, and for their own intereſſes deſire and endeavour to <hi>diſenamour themſelves of the world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amour themſelves of God,</hi> not being inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nor moved thereunto by the holy ſpirit, are much like to thoſe men, who for their own deſignes, and for their own intereſſes, do la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and endeavour to diſenamour themſelves of a baſe and vulgar thing, and to enamour themſelves of ſome other thing that is qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with much worth; not being incited there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99333:50"/> either by the ſway of their own proper affections, or by the deſire of the thing it ſelf, to which they would affectionate themſelves: I would ſay, that the difficulties, the diſtaſts, and the troubles are much alike, which the one and the other make experience of, and that neither theſe, nor thoſe do ever obtain that which they pretend.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtood, that thoſe men, whom God would <hi>diſenamour of the world, and enamour of himſelf,</hi> are much like to thoſe men, whom a perſon of quality would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from another baſe and vulgar perſon, and make enamoured of himſelf. I would ſay, that almoſt the ſelf ſame things befall to the one, as to the other; that with the ſame facility the one and the other both diſenamour and enamour themſelves; and that almoſt the ſelf ſame things betide the one and the other; and that there are almoſt the ſelf ſame conceits in the one and in the other: for as the one is forwarded to unlove, and to love by favours, and cheriſhments, and by outward demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; ſo the other is forwarded, or (to ſpeak better) is conſtrained to unlove, and to love by favours, and cheriſhments, and inward demonſtrations, ſpirituall and divine.</p>
               <p>This one notable difference I find, that the one, becauſe he loves changeable things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:99333:50"/> alwayes with fear; and the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves ſtable things is void of all fear. Furthermore I find, that the one of them hath his ſatisfaction in his own power touching that which he loves, by means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance; and the other ſtands alwayes at the mercy of God, it not being in his own power to be able to take or feel more ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then that which God will give unto him, cauſing him to feel and taſt his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>And I underſtand, that when the perſon whom God would diſenamour of the world, and enamour of himſelf, applyes himſelf by his own induſtry, and exerciſes to enamour himſelf of God, he doth experiment in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that which he proves, who for his own deſignes, and intereſſes would <hi>diſenamour himſelf of the world, and enamour himſelf of God.</hi> In ſuch ſort, that they whom God diſenamours, and enamours, can give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the eſtate of them, who labour to diſenamour, and enamour themſelves; but theſe cannot give teſtimony of the ſtate of thoſe others. Whereupon I underſtand, that men toil themſelves in vain that ſeek for their own deſignes to <hi>diſenamour themſelves of the world, and to enamour themſelves of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand that they may
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99333:51"/> judge themſelves to be moſt happy, who know that they have not been moved of themſelves to <hi>diſenamour themſelves of the world, and to enamour themſelves of God,</hi> but have been moved thereunto by the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that they who go about <hi>to diſenamour themſelves of the world, and enamour themſelves of God,</hi> looſe their labour, when without being moved by him to love, they by their own induſtry, and by their own exerciſes ſeek to diſcover Gods preſence, when he hides it from them; And when God is withdrawing himſelf from them, they for their own ſatisfaction would have him preſent.</p>
               <p>And above all things I underſtand, that the proper exerciſe of them, whom God would <hi>diſenamour of the world, and enamour of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> is to apply their minds <hi>to diſenamour themſelves of the world,</hi> not accepting of its favours, nor its cheriſhments, nor its flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but driving them away from them, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and abominating them: Not preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for all this, that God being moved by this their exerciſe, ſhould enamour them more of himſelf; but that the favours of God find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them diſpoiled and deprived of the favours of the world, will become more effectuall in them, will more penetrate, and transform them more into the love of God, and ſo they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99333:51"/> ſhall more ſpeedily and intirely obtain and get the Love of God. That this is true, every man will eaſily underſtand, that ſhall conſider, how that he that hath expelled and altogether aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the familiarity and converſation of a baſe and vulgar Perſon, comes much more eaſily to enamour himſelf of a Perſonage exceedingly qualified in worth.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed through theſe conſiderations, and underſtood theſe ſecrets, and others that are annext unto them, and that do depend on them, looking into the Holy Scripture, I have known that theſe things are very conformable to that which I have read therein: foraſmuch as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in his <hi>Canticles,</hi> doth celebrate this <hi>Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourment between God and the ſoul,</hi> and that the departing from God is called <hi>Adultery,</hi> when the ſoul leaves God, and applies it ſelf to the World. And it ſeems to me, that our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, leaving one that would have followed him, and calling another that alledged excuſe or delay, it was nothing elſe, but to refuſe the love of one, and to enamour the the other. This as I conceive he meant, to let his Apoſtles underſtand, when he ſaid unto them, <hi>you have not choſen me, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>you have not enamoured your ſelves of me, but I have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured you.</hi> And this, as I underſtand, S. <hi>John</hi> meant when he ſaid, that <hi>to become the ſonnes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99333:52"/> of God, muſt proceed, not from the will of man,</hi> nor from mans ſpirit, <hi>but by the will of God,</hi> and by the Holy Spirit; in ſuch ſort, that during this preſent life it behoveth every man to apply himſelf to <hi>diſenamour himſelf of the world,</hi> and to occupy himſelf in praying to God that he would <hi>enamour him of himſelf,</hi> to this effect give him his holy Spirit, which is obtained by believing in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>GOd generally loves all men, and he loves with particular love, all thoſe for whom he hath executed the rigour of his Juſtice upon his onely begotten Sonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Men generally hate God, and they hate him with particular hatred, who are guilty to have added other depravations to their naturall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation.</p>
               <p>The love which God bears men, proceeds from the great things which he hath done for them, in ſuch ſort, that with reaſon he loves them more, to whom juſtification by Chriſt doth appertain. And mans hatred towards God proceeds from the depravation, wherewith he offends him, (for as it is ſaid, <hi>He that offends, pardons not,</hi>) in ſuch ſort, that with reaſon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99333:52"/> they moſt hate God, that have moſt offended him.</p>
               <p>According to reaſon it ſeems that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt perfect, he ought to be moſt ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved of man, and that man being moſt highly imperfect, ought to be moſt highly hated of God. Likewiſe becauſe man hath received many good things from the Liberality of God, he ought much to love God; and God having received from man nothing but offences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, he ought to be hated of God. But on the other ſide ſo great force hath the obligation which God hath to love man for the great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that he hath done, and doth for him, that however he know the height of imperfection to be in him, &amp; that he is offended by him, he doth not leave to love him: it coming ſo to paſſe on Gods behalf in this caſe with men, as it comes to paſſe to a good father, with a diſobedient and vitious ſon, who is more drawn by the force of that which he hath done for his ſon, to love him, then by the diſobedience and depravation of his ſon to hate him. And likewiſe on the other ſide, the hatred and enmity which a man hath to God through his naturall depravation, and through the offences that he hath added to this depravation, enforce ſo much, that although man know the height of perfection in him, and although he find and feel himſelf benefited of God, he cannot onely not bring himſelf to love
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99333:53"/> God, but alſo he cannot leave to hate him. That betiding a man in this caſe with God, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides to a vitious and malignant ſon with a good father, with whom his villany, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity hath more force to hate his father, then the knowledge of his fathers goodneſſe, and of the great obligation which he hath to his father, to make him love him.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I underſtand, that God willing to be loved of man, as a good father would be loved of his ſonne, (knowing that the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this love is that which is ſpoken of, that <hi>he who offends pardons not,</hi>) executed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his juſtice upon his own ſon, as if a good father ſhould ſay to a diſobedient ſon, See, I have chaſtiſed thy brother for thy diſobedience and offences; ſince then I have taken away the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, love thou me, as I love thee.</p>
               <p>Hence I underſtand, that the intent which God had in executing the rigour of his juſtice on Chriſt, was not leſſe to ſecure me, then to ſatisfie himſelf. Further I underſtand, that a man who gives credit to this juſtice executed on Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting it, and making it his own, doth altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe the hatred which he bears to God, and begins to love God, even as the ſonne who believes that his father hath chaſtiſed his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that which he had diſobeyed in, leaves to hate his father, and begins to love him. And now I underſtand that as the ſonne deſiring, not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99333:53"/> that his father ſhould love him, for he already knows that he loves him; nor much leſſe that he ſhould love him more, for he knows that he loves him much; but he himſelf deſiring greatly to love his father, applyes himſelf with all his force to ſerve him in every thing, which he thinks to be pleaſing unto him, and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to great hazards for him, and deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all his pleaſures and all his ſatisfactions for him; conſidering that being loved by his father, and likewiſe doing great things for his father, he ſhall come to love his father greatly. Even ſo the man that is already juſtified, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring not that God ſhould love him, for he knows already that God loves him, nor that he ſhould love him more, for he knows that he loves him much; but he himſelf deſiring to love God much, applies himſelf with all his force to ſerve God; knowing that being beloved of God for the great things which God hath done, and doth for him, that he alſo doing great things for God, ſhall come to love God greatly.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the great ſinnes which God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned us, makes us to grow in the love of God, as the conſideration of the great offences which we have done, when we do not feel the pardon, makes us to grow in hatred.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that the ſervices which thoſe perſons who are governed by the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:99333:54"/> Spirit of God, do to God, are not done to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the obligation with which they were born; neither are they done as humane wiſdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs, and as humane Philoſophy teacheth; pretending piety, thereby to oblige God, either to the intent that he ſhould pardon their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or that he ſhould love them; but properly to bind themſelves to love God more, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day more to increaſe in the love of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that the ſervices unto which the holy Spirit applies theſe perſons, are to disenamour them of themſelves, and of the world, and to enamour them of God, and of thoſe perſons that love God. And I underſtand that then a man diſenamours himſelf of himſelf, when he deprives himſelf of all thoſe things which may give, or cauſe unto him outward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in any kind whatſoever. And then, as I underſtand, he diſenamours himſelf of the world, when he takes away and apparts from his mind all thought to ſatisfie and pleaſe the world in things of the world, and when any occaſion offers it ſelf, he puts this deliberation in effect.</p>
               <p>And then I underſtand a man affectionates himſelf to God, and to the perſons that love God, when he applyes himſelf with his mind unto them; when by ſervice and benefits he doth oblige himſelf to love them, doing unto them that which he would do unto God
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:99333:54"/> himſelf, if he ſaw him to have need of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, accordingly as David ſaith he himſelf did, Pſal. 16.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, that to ſuffer for Chriſt, and for the confeſſion and manifeſtation of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, doth above all things enamour them of God and Chriſt, that ſo ſuffer. And I underſtand, that in their ſufferings, love doth in great part deprive them of the ſenſe of that which they ſuffer.</p>
               <p>And withall this I underſtand, that without compariſon the love which God bears a pious &amp; juſt man, however ſorry a one and imperfect he be, is much greater then that love which a pious and juſt perſon, however much perfect he be, bears to God; even as a good father more loves a ſonne, however ſorry a one he be, then a ſonne, however good he be, loves his father: And becauſe this is ſo, it is no marvell if they who be ſuch live with much ſecurity, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this preſent life any thing ſhall befall them that ſhall be evil for them, nor that that felicity which is promiſed to them that are pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and juſt, ſhall be wanting unto them in the life everlaſting; knowing the particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; and they are juſt, accepting the juſtice of God executed on Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Very great part of Chriſtian piety, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, conſiſteth in this, That a man ſhould never diſpoſe of himſelf, nor put his own will in execution, nor ſay in his thoughts, <hi>This would be well for me,</hi> if ſo be he have not ſome evident ſigne of the will of God: In ſuch ſort, that when the ſtate wherein he finds himſelf, the place, or the manner of living ſhall become weariſome to him, &amp; there ſhall come thoughts into his mind, that <hi>This or that thing would fit him well;</hi> he ſhall preſently ſay, <hi>But what know I, if this would be good for me? God is he, who knows what is good; and ſince he knows it, to him I offer and reſigne my ſelf, that he ſhould ſet me in it; and in the mean ſpace I will believe, that that which is beſt for me, is to continue in the ſtate wherein I am.</hi> With this reſolution a man condemns the judgement of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and reaſon, and renounceth his naturall light, and enters into the kingdome of God, reſigning himſelf to the regiment and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that albeit to ſome Saints of the Old Teſtament, and to others of the New, God hath manifeſted his will as it were by words; yet the common language now,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99333:55"/> with which God ſpeaks to the pious, is to put into their hearts that which they ſhould do, and afterwards to neceſſitate them to do it, or to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the execution thereof: In ſuch ſort, that when a pious perſon ſhall feel himſelf moved to change his ſtate, place, or manner of living, or whatſoever other thing, in which he ſhall be doubtfull whether it be a motion of the Spirit, or of the fleſh; if he ſhall ſee himſelf neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>put it in execution,</hi> or ſhall find much facility in executing it; he ſhall take it, that God declares his will unto him by this means; and holding that demonſtration for a ſufficient token of Gods will, he ſhall not doubt <hi>to put it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</hi> If he ſhall haue the will, but neither the neceſsity, nor the facility, he ſhall keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quiet; and if ſo be he ſhall have the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or the facility, and not the will, he ſhall likewiſe abide quiet; ſaying, <hi>If this be the will of God, he will put it into my will, that I ſhould put it in execution.</hi> In this he ſhall ſo much more aſſure himſelf, inaſmuch as I underſtand and hold for certain and firm, God is ſo jealous of them that attend to this piety, that even then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſo much ſolicited by ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, &amp; by humane affections, that they come to deſire to put their own wills in execution. God himſelf hinders them, to the intent they ſhould not come to deprave themſelves, except when he means to puniſh them; letting them fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:99333:56"/> that which they deſire, becauſe they hold it a good thing for them; as he puniſhed David in the caſe of Bathſheba; and this puniſhment is very terrible; which as I underſtand doth not conſiſt in the <hi>execution</hi> of that thing which a man deſires, but in the knowledge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience wherein he finds himſelf to be fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len after the <hi>execution.</hi> In theſe like caſes alſo pious perſons know the will of God, but it is that will of his which is with wrath and with fury; and ſo they do confirm themſelves in this matter, and think that nothing befits them, but that in which they find themſelves: And they ſtand attentive to heare the language of God, when he moves the will, and facilitateth and neceſſitateth the <hi>execution</hi> thereof. With which language I underſtand that God alſo ſpeaks unto the impious, as he ſpake to <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> and as he ſpake to <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and as he ſpake to <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> But there is very great difference in that which they that are pious do, and in that which they do that are impious; foraſmuch as they neither knew, nor do know the will of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore albeit they did it, yet for all this they did not ſerve, nor do ſerve God therein. But the pious, becauſe they know the <hi>will of God,</hi> and knowing it <hi>put it in execution,</hi> they ſerve God therein. And inaſmuch as they who are ſuch, do ſet themſelves to all their

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99333:57"/> things humane wiſdome ſaith, ſince they be not vices, nay rather being virtues in brute beaſts, it is no wayes juſt to ſay that the ſelf ſame ſhould be ſinnes in unregenerated men; for in ſuch caſe the condition of mankind would come to be worſe then that of brute beaſts. Here I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand humane wiſdome deceives it ſelf, inaſmuch as it doth not conſider, that the brute beaſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither wiſdome, nor reaſon, doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of God, nor the inſtitution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and a man not regenerated by the holy Spirit, by his prudence and reaſon doth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pervert and alter it; nay, he cannot leave to pervert and alter it, inaſmuch as being proud, he goes mending the works of God by his own reaſon, and by his own prudence, and inaſmuch as loving himſelf in every thing that he doth, he pretends his own intereſt, and his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per glory; and ſo he doth not follow the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall order, nor intend the glory of God. In ſuch ſort as the father bringing up the ſonne, and the ſonne nouriſhing the father, every one of them intends onely his own glory, and his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and his own ſatisfaction.

               <p>Whereupon I conſider in this preſent life that which is in the houſe of a great lord, who hath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99333:57"/> thirty ſlaves, for whom he doth ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide all neceſſary things, and appoint them the things, in which he will be ſerved of them. Of theſe thirty ſlaves I imagine that ten of them are fooles, without underſtanding, and without any manner of diſcourſe, altogether as beaſts. Theſe as I underſtand without perverting, and without altering the order which their lord hath given them, do that which is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, not pretending any thing elſe, but onely to obey their lord: The other ten, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are well experienced, and have judgement, and diſcretion, who pretending to know and underſtand as much as their lord, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, pervert the order that is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſuppoſing to find the point better, and having an eye to their own intereſſes, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes an eye to gain their liberty, and to be better intreated, and more cheriſhed of their lord, not contenting themſelves with their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, nor contenting themſelves with that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary entertainment which they receive from their lord: The other ten, I imagine to my ſelf, are likewiſe experienced, and underſtanding, and ſuch as have judgement, wit and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but perſwading themſelves that their lord knows more then they, and no wayes priding themſelves of their own knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without perverting or altering the order that is given unto them, obey their lords
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99333:58"/> meaning, and content themſelves with their ſervitude and entertainment, aiming onely in the doing the will of their lord, at his profit, ſatisfaction, and glory. The firſt ten ſerve but like beaſts with their bodies, and theſe in the world are the brute beaſts. The ſecond ten in ſerving, pretend to ſerve, but offend; and then offend moſt, when they ſerve moſt, and beſt; for then they do moſt alter, and pervert the will and order of their lord: And theſe are all men, inaſmuch as they are not <hi>regenerated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit:</hi> The third ten ſerve as obedient Sons, not perverting nor altering the order and will of their lord; and they ſerve both with their bodies; and with their minds; and theſe are the men that are <hi>regenerated by the holy Spirit,</hi> without which <hi>regeneration</hi> it is impoſſible that men ſhould reduce themſelves to this degree. and therefore Saint Paul well ſaith, that <hi>the fleſh is the enemy of God, and is not ſubject to the law and will of God;</hi> neither though it would, could it; inaſmuch as a man doting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own wiſdom, and his own reaſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to mend the works of God, and inaſmuch as being enamoured of himſelf, in every thing which he doth, he hath an eye unto himſelf.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99333:58"/> perſons, who believing in Jeſus Chriſt, and accepting as their own Gods juſtice, that he executed upon Chriſt, are changed and renewed in all their affections and deſires, in ſuch ſort, that no wayes pretending in the execution of their own appetites, nor in the ſway of their own affections, that which they did pretend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their regeneration, have loſt that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to go about mending of Gods works, and have loſt their own love, whereby they loved themſelves, as if one of the ten ſlaves of the ſecond order ſhould paſſe to the number of the ten of the third order.</p>
               <p>Thoſe men who by wit and humane artifice pretend to change and renew themſelves, as I underſtand, do not obtain this Chriſtian rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but that which is humane, that which is of the fleſh, and of humane wiſdome, and reaſon; ſuch as was that of ſome heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.

               <p>THe man that being called of God, feeling his vocation and anſwering unto it, applies himſelf with his mind to piety, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is firſt moved to reſolve himſelf touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, not willing to have from it any greater part, then that wich it ſhall pleaſe God to give him in the dignities and eſtimation thereof; and he is moved to reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, not deſiring touching his body, either more commodities, or any better condition in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward matters, then it ſhall pleaſe God to put him into. Furthermore I underſtand, that a man cannot maintain himſelf in his reſolution with the world, if ſo be he do not <hi>mortifie</hi> the affections that live in him, of Ambition, and Avarice, and of ſelf-eſtimation; neither can he ſuſtain himſelf in his <hi>Reſolution</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

               <p>And hence alſo I underſtand, that for a pious perſon to reſent and grieve himſelf at thoſe things, which happen amiſſe to him touching his body, is not a ſigne that he hath not <hi>certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Gods providence,</hi> but that he hath not reduced his mind to content himſelf with that which God doth.

               <p>FOraſmuch as I underſtand, it doth greatly import, that a man ſhould be <hi>certain that he is called of God to the grace of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> that is, to the intent that believing in Chriſt he ſhould obtain immortality and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: (for this certainty works in him the reſolution with the world, and with himſelf, and mortification, by which he is maintained in his reſolutions.) I come now to ſay, that a perſon that ſhall not have had a <hi>Vocation</hi> ſo evident clear and outward, as was that of Saint Paul, after the coming of the holy Spirit; or as was that of the Apoſtles, whileſt Chriſt converſed with men; nor ſo effectuall and powerfull as in ſome perſons, in whom although it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, yet the effects are ſo evident as may ſerve for outward; but ſhall have had a quiet, and remiſſe <hi>Vocation,</hi> as it is in thoſe perſons, in whom it being inward, and not able to ſhew it ſelf by outward ſignes, becauſe they are of themſelves outwardly moderate in their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and appetites: I ſay, that ſuch a perſon may <hi>certifie</hi> himſelf of his <hi>Vocation,</hi> by the ſenſe and feeling that he hath of his juſtification through faith. I would ſay, that when a pious perſon being moved unto Chriſtian piety, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood the motion, ſhall doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99333:61"/> he were moved and called of God, or onely moved by his own ſelf-love; finding in himſelf ſome ſenſe of his juſtification by Faith, that is peace of conſcience, (which all they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who believing make Gods juſtice their own) he may well aſſure himſelf, that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to piety was the <hi>Vocation</hi> of God, and no deſigne of humane wiſdome; this being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that onely they who are <hi>called</hi> of God, do feel in themſelves the benefit of Gods juſtice executed on Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Eaſineſſe</hi> with which they believe the matters of Chriſtian Faith, who believe by Opinion, by Relation, and by perſwaſion; and the <hi>Difficulty</hi> with which they believe them, who believe them by Inſpiration, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, hath led me to this Conſideration; that they who believe by <hi>Relation,</hi> amongſt ſome true things believe many falſe, and are likewiſe more eaſie to believe falſe things then true; and they who believe by Revelation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve onely true things, and of falſities they admit none; in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>difficulty of believing</hi> is rather a ſigne of <hi>Vocation,</hi> then the <hi>eaſineſſe.</hi> He that believes by Revelation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves as much as he feels, and becauſe in thoſe things which he doth not feel, he finds contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,

               <argument>
                  <p>That the livelineſse of Affections is more damageable then that of the Appetites; and that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that both the one, and the other ſhould be mortified.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>EXamining in what properly the <hi>livelineſſe of affections, and of the Appetites</hi> doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and when this <hi>livelineſſe</hi> doth offend, and when it doth not offend: I reſolve my ſelf, that <hi>the livelineſſe of affections</hi> conſiſteth in the inward ſatisfaction that is according to the fleſh, that is, when a man abides alive and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous in reliſhing with the ſenſes of his mind, the things that belong to the world, ſuch as are honours done to him, ſelf-boaſtings, and that which is principall, his reputation and fame. And I underſtand that the <hi>livelineſſe of appetites</hi> conſiſteth in the outward ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that is, when a man abides alive and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to reliſh with his five bodily ſenſes, the things that delight and content the ſenſuality. And reſolving my ſelf, that this <hi>livelineſſe of affections and appetites</hi> is then hurtfull, when he who hath it knows it not, underſtands it not, or doth not hold it for a fault, or defect; and that then it doth not hurt, when he that hath it knows it, and underſtands it, and holding it for a defect &amp; a vice, goes by little and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining and mortifying it: I come to conſider, which of the two is moſt <hi>damageable,</hi> and moſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:99333:63"/> contrary to the holy ſpirit, either the <hi>livelineſſe of affections, or that of the appetites?</hi> In this reſolution, I come firſt to conſider, that the <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of affections</hi> holds the inward man alive in the things of the world; and that the <hi>live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of appetites</hi> holds the outward man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live in things of the fleſh. And I underſtand that by how much the ſoul is more worthy then the body, by ſo much is the <hi>livelineſſe of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> more contrary to the ſpirit, then that of the fleſh. Furthermore I conſider in this matter; A certain perſon goes to a feaſt for his own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I would ſay, to ſatisfie his appetites in ſeeing, hearing, ſmelling, taſting, and touching; and another perſon goes to comply with the world for the ſatisfaction of him that makes the feaſt: And it will ſeem, that in him that goes for his own ſatisfaction there is a greater <hi>liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> then in him that goes for others ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it is not true: for if in him that goes for others ſatisfaction, the affections of his own proper eſtimation, and of the honour of the world, were not alive, he would not go: In ſuch ſort, that albeit he doth not go being drawn by his appetites, yet he goes being drawn by his own affections, and by theirs whom he deſires to pleaſe. It being very true, that that perſon that goes for his own ſatisfaction, ſatisfies his own appetites; and he that goes for others ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſatisfies his own affections and others: It is
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:99333:64"/> clear that the <hi>ſatisfaction of the affections</hi> is more damageable, and more contrary to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, then that of the <hi>appetites.</hi> Furthermore I conſider, that in the eyes of humane wiſdome he is reprehended, and defamed, that is unbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledly <hi>alive in his appetites;</hi> and he is praiſed and honoured, that is moderate and temperate in them; and he is eſteemed to be a Saint, that hath altogether <hi>mortified</hi> them. And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he is eſteemed and prized, that keeps <hi>lively in his affections</hi> of honour, and his own particular eſteem; and he is eſteemed vile and of no worth, that is in all theſe things <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Now it being true, that to the eyes of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome that alwayes appears great, which to the eyes of the holy Spirit ſeems little; and that alwayes appears little to humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which appears great to the holy Spirit; it will eaſily follow that humane wiſdome hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>appetites more damageable then the affections,</hi> the holy Spirit will hold <hi>the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions more damageable then the appetites.</hi> Many other things might be conſidered to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, but theſe abundantly ſuffice to come to my intent, which is this, that that perſon, who ſtudies to be like unto Chriſt, and like unto God, and to comprehend the Chriſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (in which he is comprized by the incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby he ſtands incorporated in Chriſt) muſt attend to <hi>the mortification of his affections
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:99333:64"/> and appetites,</hi> alwayes keeping ſtrict account with them, to kill them in that wherein he ſhall ſee them alive. But principally he ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the <hi>mortification of his affections,</hi> as well for that reſpect which we have ſpoken of, as alſo becauſe in the death of the <hi>affections,</hi> the <hi>appetites</hi> die; but the <hi>affections</hi> do not at all die in the death of the <hi>appetites;</hi> nay it comes to paſſe, that in the death of the <hi>appetites</hi> the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> revive: for as hath been ſaid, in the eyes of humane wiſdome the <hi>mortification of the appetites</hi> is very highly eſteemed of, and therefore a man is praiſed and honoured for it.</p>
               <p>Hereby I underſtand this, That when any perſon <hi>kills his affections</hi> by humane wiſdome and induſtry, deſpiſing honour, and reputation of the world; he grows vicious and licentious; for the <hi>appetites</hi> live and grow unbridled: And when another perſon <hi>kills his affections</hi> by the holy Spirit, he doth together therewith <hi>kill his appetites:</hi> by which proof a man may judge of many deſignes and motions pertaining to the deſpiſing of the world, whether they be of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſpirit, or from the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>I would to God that in me the <hi>affections</hi> were altogether dead, and likewiſe the <hi>appetites,</hi> ſo that neither my mind ſhould be delighted with any thing that were not ſpirituall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, nor my body ſhould take of the things of the world more then that which ſufficeth to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99333:65"/> it in the world the time that God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained that it ſhould live here! But if ſo be I muſt run out in any thing, and that ſome kind of <hi>livelineſſe</hi> will remain in me, that of the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites</hi> would leſſe diſpleaſe me, then that of the <hi>affections.</hi> I would ſay, I ſhould hold it for leſſe inconvenient to ſee in me ſome <hi>livelineſſe of appetites,</hi> and to ſatisfie my ſelf in them; then to ſee in my ſelf any <hi>livelineſſe of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and to ſatisfie my ſelf and others in them. Nay verily, if the ſhame of the world, and the ill example I ſhould give to ſpirituall perſons did not reſtrain me, I could ſcarce contain my ſelf ſometimes from ſuffering my ſelf to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to the ſatisfaction of my <hi>appetites,</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for certain, that by that means I ſhould ſooner <hi>mortifie my affections,</hi> and that my <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections dying,</hi> my <hi>appetites</hi> would alſo <hi>die</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>I will adde this, that the <hi>affections are morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> when a man having opportunity to grow in honour and reputation, and in much credit with men, will not, but renounceth all: And that the <hi>appetites are mortified,</hi> when a man properly may ſatisfie them, and doth not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them.</p>
               <p>He that <hi>mortifies his appetites,</hi> doth kill his fleſh; and he that <hi>mortifies his affections</hi> cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelf entirely with Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>In ſaying, That ſometimes ſatisfying my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99333:65"/> I ſhould think to <hi>mortifie my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> I mean this, that the ſhame and confuſion which I ſhould deſerve in having <hi>ſatisfied my appetites,</hi> would be a cauſe that I ſhould not think of being honoured and praiſed, and ſo ſatisfie my affections whileſt I mortifie my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites.

               <p>I Underſtand that learned men being without the Spirit, do ſuffer the ſelf ſame deceit in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> which unlearned men without the ſpirit of God do in <hi>images;</hi> in this manner: An unlearned ſuperſtitious man keeps a <hi>crucifix</hi> of Chriſt in his chamber, by means whereof, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes when he enters into his chamber, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> Chriſt ſuffered; &amp; finding (as he thinks) piety &amp; religion in this remembrance, he puts in all other parts of his houſe other <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> like unto that; &amp; knowing well that alwaies as he walks up and down his houſe, he ſhall ſee theſe <hi>images,</hi> which will bring to his memorie that which Chriſt ſuffered, he cares not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in his mind Chriſt crucified, contenting himſelf to ſee him painted: and as long as he doth not keep him in his mind, he neither feels nor taſts the benefit of Chriſts Paſſion. And it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99333:66"/> comes to paſſe, that when this ſuperſtitious un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned man is moved to demand any thing of Chriſt, it ſeeming ſufficient to him to behold him painted with his bodily eyes, he careth not to lift up his mind to behold him with ſpirituall eyes; in ſuch ſort, that a man may ſay, that he doth not pray unto Chriſt, but unto that <hi>picture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſelf ſame manner a learned man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit, keeps written in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> the things that pertain to a Chriſtian man [both] that which he ought to believe, and that which he ought to do; in ſuch ſort, that when ever he gets his book, he underſtands both the one and the other: And this ſeeming ſufficient to him, he employes all his ſtudy and diligence in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many books, that may declare unto him the ſenſe and meaning of the <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> not caring at all to imprint in his mind that which he reads, and that which he ſtudies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, nor to frame his opinions, nor his conceits in things pertaining unto Chriſtian piety, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he there reads, and ſtudies. And being deſirous to underſtand ſome ſecret of God, and of ſpirituall matters, applying himſelf to ſeek it in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> he doth not lift up his mind to pray God that he would ſhew it him, and teach it him ſo, that he doth take for his aim the ſpirit of God; but [he contents himſelf with] that which by his own proper nature and wit he learns from that which was written
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99333:66"/> by them, who had the ſpirit of God. And if ſo be they ſuffer this deceit, that handle the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> which were written by the holy Spirit, what may we think is the deceit of them, who handle the writings that are written by humane ſpirits?</p>
               <p>The unlearned man that hath the ſpirit, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf with <hi>images,</hi> as with an Alphabet of Chriſtian piety; foraſmuch as he ſo much ſerves himſelf with the <hi>picture</hi> of Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, as ſerves to imprint in his mind that which Chriſt ſuffered, and to taſt and feel the benefit of Chriſt. And when he hath imprinted him, and taſteth and feeleth him, he cares no more for the <hi>picture,</hi> leaving it to ſerve for an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet to other beginners: And when he hath Chriſt in his mind, and is inſpired to demand any thing of Chriſt, he careth not to ſet his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eyes on the <hi>picture,</hi> but ſets his ſpirituall eyes on the impreſſion, which he keeps in his mind: In like manner, a learned man that hath the ſpirit, ſerveth himſelf of <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> as of an<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>ACcording to Saint Paul,<note place="margin">The doctrine of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration cleareth that of the former: for as the ſervant leaves not the letter when he hath read it, but keeps it by him, and reads it again and again, and the more the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is delayed, the more he reads it, and fortifies himſelf with it; ſo are we to do with the Scriptures, and this is the uſe of the promiſes of the Scriptures. But the uſe of the doctrinall part is more, in regard it preſents us not with the ſame thing onely when it is read, as the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do, but enlightens us with new conſiderations the more we reade it.

               </argument>
               <p>A Certain rich man hath a woman ſlave, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ill inclined, who hath her children alſo vitious and ill inclined, as her ſelf is. He becauſe they be ſuch, will not for ſome time keep them in his houſe; but at another time for ſome other occaſion he contents himſelf to keep and maintain ſome of them in his houſe; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to the end they may the more willingly ſtay with him, it pleaſeth him to uſe them as ſonnes; and becauſe he ſees their evil inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſees, that if ſo be he goes by the way of rigour with them, it will be impoſſible to keep them in his houſe, he doth [therefore] not onely pardon them for being born of a vitious and ill inclined ſlave, (for, foraſmuch as concerns this point, he did ſet his mind at quiet, when he took them into his houſe) but he likewiſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all that which they ſhall do, being viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and villanouſly drawn, and overcome by the evil inclination with which they were born. And they by the good uſage of their Lord, (who hath made himſelf a Father unto them,) and by the good cuſtomes that they learn, being in his houſe, leave that which they inherit from their old and evil mother, and get that which they ſee in their new and good Father: and in this manner they come to be heirs of the goods of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99333:69"/> their Lord, who is become unto them a Father. By this ſimilitude I underſtand, in what Chriſts benefit towards men doth conſiſt. The rich man is God: The evil ſlave is humane nature depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the firſt transgreſsion: Her ſonnes are all mankind: The houſe of God is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: The time in which God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits men into his kingdome is the time of the Goſpel: The occaſion is the juſtice of God executed on Jeſus Chriſt our Lord: For this, God is content to admit into his kingdome them that come unto him, and to hold them for ſonnes, and ſo uſe them as ſonnes. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows their evil inclination, and ſees that if he [ſhould] uſe rigour with them, it will be impoſſible for them to keep themſelves in his kingdome, he [therefore] pardoneth them not onely the fault of their depraved nature, with which they are born, which is originall ſinne, (for foraſmuch as belongs to originall ſinne, he pardons it when he admits them to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;) but alſo all thoſe things which they ſhall do vitiouſly and villanouſly, being drawn, and overcome by that evil inclination with which they were born, (which is proper and naturall unto them) whileſt they reſiſt and ſtrive with it. Whereupon they by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, who of a Lord is become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a Father, making them ſonnes of ſlaves, and by the good cuſtomes which they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99333:69"/> learn continuing in the kingdome of God, do by little and little forſake that which they hold of their old evil and vicious mother; and get that which they ſee in their new good and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, leaving, both to appear and to be like their mother. And as before they came unto the kingdome of God, they had and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in them the image and the likeneſſe of depraved nature; ſo likewiſe being entred into the kingdome of God, they have and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent in themſelves the image and ſimilitude of God; recovering that which the firſt man loſt. By this I underſtand in what ſort man was created unto the likeneſſe and ſimilitude of God, and in what doth conſiſt the benefit that men have received by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>COnſidering that the duty of Piety is for a man to content himſelf with every thing which God doth, perſwading himſelf and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for certain, that every thing that ſo comes to him, is Good, Holy, and Juſt; believing that all that which comes to paſſe in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, comes to paſſe by divine providence, without admitting that any thing ſhould come to paſſe by chance: And conſidering that the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99333:70"/> duty of Chriſtian Faith is to accept with his mind, and to confeſſe with his mouth, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. I ſee on one ſide in many men that have not the ſpirit, much conformity to the will of God, in ſuch manner, that they neither grieve themſelves, nor reſent out of meaſure the death of thoſe perſons whom they greatly love, nor the loſſe of goods, nor the loſſe of honour, and that they themſelves are content to die: And I ſee likewiſe in many other men that have not the ſpirit, much acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and much confeſſion of the Goſpel, without any ſcruple or doubt at all. And I ſee on the other ſide, that ſome ſpirituall perſons grieve themſelves, reſent, and are very ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the death of thoſe perſons whom they loved, and for other inconveniences that befall them, and they cannot bring themſelves to be willing to die, and that they feel the loſſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and the loſſe of honour; And I ſee alſo in other perſons who have the ſpirit, much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in the acceptation, and confeſſion of the Goſpel, that they cannot believe, nor confirm themſelves in all that is therein. I have many times ſet my ſelf to conſider the cauſes whence theſe contrary effects ſhould proceed; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it ſeems, that in him who hath not the ſpirit, there ſhould not be conformity with the will of God, nor ſhould he give credit to the Goſpel: and in him that hath the ſpirit, there
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99333:70"/> ought to be both the one and the other. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration I underſtand, that however fleſh doth ſometimes a little contradict fleſh, yet in the end fleſh ſuffers her ſelf to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſubdued by the fleſh: whereupon there being in a man that hath not the ſpirit, as well an affection of the fleſh willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it ſelf with God, as to grieve, to be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to reſent it ſelf for the inconveniences that offer themſelves in this preſent life; it comes to paſſe, that one affection overcoming the other, it ſeems that ſuch a man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf with the will of God, but it is not true: for he doth conform himſelf, but onely with his own proper will, whereby, for his own ſatisfaction, and for his own deſignes, he doth determine to content himſelf with every thing, and to conform himſelf in all things to the will of God.</p>
               <p>That this is true, we read in many books of the Gentiles, and we hear and ſee it in many other Nations altogether Infidels, and others that counterfeit faith. Likewiſe I underſtand, that there being in a man that hath not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as well an affection of the fleſh to accept and confeſſe the Goſpel, as not to accept nor confeſſe it; it comes to paſſe that one affection overcoming the other, it ſeems that ſuch an one believes the Goſpel; but it is not true: for he doth believe onely his own opinion and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:99333:71"/> imagination, as the Jew that ſtands ſtubborn in his Law, and as the Moor that believes his Alcoran.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, I underſtand that the fleſh alwayes repugnes againſt the ſpirit, alwayes contradicts it, and alwayes ſtruggles with it, by reaſon of the great enmity that is between them two. Whereupon it comes to paſſe that there being in a man that hath the ſpirit, an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſpirit, that makes him willing to conform himſelf to the will of God, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf with every thing that God doth, and combating and reſiſting the fleſh, which is not ſoon overcome; it comes to paſſe that the man who hath the ſpirit, laments, reſents, and is grieved for the corporall incommodities, and for all thoſe other things, in which the fleſh ſuffers, and above all things for death. For ſo we ſee that the Saints of the Law did grieve themſelves; and Saint Paul, a Saint of the Goſpel would have reſented it as himſelf ſaith, Phil. 2.27. if that friend of his Epaphroditus had died; and even the ſonne of God our Lord God Jeſus Chriſt did reſent himſelf, and was grieved at the death of Lazarus, Mat. 26.38.</p>
               <p>In like manner I underſtand, that there being in the man which hath the ſpirit, an affection of the ſpirit to be willing to accept, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Goſpel, and the fleſh repugning and contradicting, becauſe it hath no part in ſuch
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:99333:71"/> deſire, nor in ſuch will; it comes to paſſe that a man that hath the ſpirit, feels a weakneſſe in his faith, and goes wavering and doubting in it, as we have read in ſome Saints, and as we ſee it in others; in ſuch ſort, that as from the ſmall contradiction which the affections of the fleſh have amongſt themſelves, there comes forth an appearance of Piety, and Faith, in them that have not the ſpirit: ſo from the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that is between the Fleſh and the Spirit, there proceeds from them that have the ſpirit, a weakneſſe in piety and faith: that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falling in a man, which befalls in the world, in a Province, or in a Common-wealth; that as it comes to paſſe, when any perſon ſpeaketh or publiſheth any thing with an affection of the ſpirit, he preſently finds an oppoſition, contradiction, and outward perſecution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a thing which is ordinarily ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and practiſed, but without the ſpirit, and out of humane affections: ſo likewiſe when a man goes about through the motion of the ſpirit to perſwade himſelf, and <hi>confirm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any thing pertaining to piety, or juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> he ſuddenly finds an inward oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and contradiction: for his own affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and his own appetites, which are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall enemies to the ſpirit, riſe up againſt him. And this comes to paſſe, notwithſtanding that the ſelf ſame things have been formerly acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:99333:72"/> and believed of him by his own proper affection and opinion.</p>
               <p>Whereupon I gather this concluſion, That it is a ſigne, that it is the holy Spirit which works in a man the will and deſire to increaſe in piety and juſtification, when a man finds in himſelf much oppoſition and contradiction; and when alſo he finds outward oppoſition from men. And I reſolve my ſelf, that in this fight and oppoſition a man ought to labour and travell much, but without afflicting, or grieving himſelf; for although the fleſh toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all its affections remain alive, yet the holy Spirit ſhall have the victory, and be the conquerour. For it is not meet that the ſonne of the ſlave, that is, the fleſh, ſhould be heir with the ſonne of the free-woman, that is, the ſpirit, of thoſe goods that properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſpirit, that is, of the knowledge of God, in the preſent life, and of the viſion of God, in life everlaſting. And ſaying the fleſh, I underſtand the affection of fleſh, that which men receive from Adam, all which muſt needs die in us, to the intent that all that may live in us, which we can receive from Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THat it may be well underſtood, wherein <hi>Chriſtian liberty doth conſiſt, how it is known, and how it is exerciſed,</hi> it imports much to underſtand firſt in what the Hebrew ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude did conſiſt, how it was underſtood, and how it was exerciſed. The Hebrew ſervitude, as I underſtand, proceeded from the command of the law, which by threatnings and promiſes kept men in ſervitude, and intreated them as ſervants. Amongſt the Hebrew people, ſome applyed themſelves to the law by inſpiration, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of opinion; and there were others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo who cared not for the law, living licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; theſe knew not the Hebrew ſervitude, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſed themſelves in it. They who out of opinion applyed themſelves to the law, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and procuring that the curſes wherewith the law threatned tranſgreſſors, ſhould not be executed on them, and that the promiſes which the law made to them that obſerved it, might be fulfilled in them, knew the Hebrew ſervitude, but did not exerciſe it as they ought: for being governed by their own proper ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, they were moſt ſuperſtitious in ſome things, and moſt licentious in others. They
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:99333:73"/> who by inſpiration applyed themſelves unto the law, and exerciſed themſelves in it, as was meet, deſiring the promiſes thereof, and fearing the threatnings, knew the Hebrew ſervitude, ſeeing that it behooved them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to ſtand knit unto the law, and they exerciſed themſelves in it as was meet, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves for ſervants, and depending on the will of God; for being governed by the holy ſpirit, that did inſpire them to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the law, they were pious, holy, and juſt. In ſuch ſort, that the Hebrew ſervitude conſiſted in the law, and was known when men applyed themſelves to the obſervation of the law; and was exerciſed, when the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication proceeded from the holy Spirit. On the contrary, the <hi>Chriſtian liberty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in the abrogation of the law,</hi> which was altogether abrogated in the coming of the holy Spirit, which ſucceeded in place of the law to govern the people of God.</p>
               <p>Among them who have the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, there are ſome, who feel this Liberty by the holy ſpirit; there are others who gueſſe at it by humane ſpirit; and there are others, who neither feel nor gueſſe at it.</p>
               <p>They who neither feel, nor divine it, are altogether like unto them amongſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew people, who divined the ſervitude of the law, being in all things moſt ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:99333:73"/> obliging and binding themſelves not onely to that which they think to be the law of God, but alſo to that which they know to be the law of man; and more then this, they themſelves do oblige and bind themſelves to other laws; in ſuch ſort, as they know not in what <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> doth conſiſt, neither do they exerciſe it, living wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in miſerable and hard ſervitude. They, who by humane ſpirit divine <hi>Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> are much like unto them amongſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew people, who made no account of the law, they taking away from themſelves all manner of yoke, live licentiouſly, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor exerciſing the <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> as is meet. They are ordinarily impious and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and I underſtand that they divine <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty,</hi> by humane ſpirit, who by their own wit and judgement, and by that which they read and hear, that a Chriſtian man is free, not conſidering whether they be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in ſuch manner, as that <hi>Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> appertains to them; theſe call the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the fleſh, <hi>Christian liberty.</hi>

Neither fearing to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

And it is well exerciſed when men obſerve the decorum that belongs to a Chriſtian, who is a member of Chriſt, and ought in all things to be very conformable to Chriſt.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99333:76"/> we account him covetous, we offer unto him our goods, and we adorn him with ornaments of gold, of ſilver, and of jewels.

               <p>They who accepting the Goſpel, and through the covenant of juſtification which is by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, are made the ſonnes of God, and having familiarity with God, know God, and get a new opinion of God, and frame new thoughts of God, not now by relation but by knowledge and experience; and going unto the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> with their new thoughts, find written in it the ſelf ſame which they know and experiment: they find that God is patient, mercifull, ſlow to wrath, and eſtranged from revenge; except it be in them that are the veſſels of wrath, whom alſo God for ſometime ſuffers. Underſtanding this, they drive out of their minds all ſcruples, fears, and terrours; they underſtand that God is full of ſuch loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that to give eternall life to men, he ſent into the world his own ſonne, made a man, on whom he executed the rigour of his juſtice, whereby they know, that he doth not delight that men ſhould puniſh their own perſons; but this indeed he requires, that they ſhould in ſuch ſort be diſpoiled of ſelf love, that being evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated upon whatſoever occaſion, they ſhould not be grieved nor reſent themſelves; And that he would not that they ſhould deprive themſelves of their goods, but that they ſhould poſſeſſe them in ſuch manner, that being by whatever occaſion deprived of them, they ſhould not eſteem it for evil, nor be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99333:77"/> and that it being neceſſary to leave them, God calling them to the preaching and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Goſpel, they ſhould immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave them, and deprive themſelves of them. Finally, theſe perſons holding this new opinion, and theſe new conceits of God, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God firſt in Chriſt, are juſt and holy; and knowing that God delights himſelf in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, they ſerve him in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe. And alſo acknowledging God in naturall things, they content themſelves with all things, after whatſoever manner they come to paſſe; they follow willingly that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which God hath ſet, without being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or reſenting themſelves for any of thoſe things which befall them, holding them all for good, and juſt, and holy; although ſometimes according to the judgement of humane wiſdome they be judged the contrary. And becauſe they underſtand that God is delighted with this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and this mortification of humane wiſdome, in ſerving with obedience, and with mortification, they ſerve with piety: In this they abide whileſt they remain in the opinion and in the conceits which are had of God, by the familiarity, and by the knowledge, and by the experience that they have of God, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the covenant of juſtification, which is by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. They as I underſtand, not onely find no ſatisfaction in thoſe things
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99333:78"/> which they do, who ſtand in that opinion of God, and in thoſe conceits of God, which are had by <hi>relation of men;</hi> but if they be neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do them, they feel diſpleaſure and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content: And this diſpleaſure, and this diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in theſe things, I underſtand to be a good counterſigne for to know that a man hath now loſt the opinion, and thoſe conceits of God which are by relation of men, and hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that opinion, and thoſe conceits of God which are by familiarity, and by the knowledge of God, and by the experience of thoſe things which are by the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>By this Conſideration I underſtand the cauſe why a perſon beginning to have familiarity with God, and to have experience of the things of the ſpirit of God, it ſeems every day to him that the knowledge of God is renewed in him, that is, that he comes anew to know God; becauſe that holding a long time imprinted in his mind that opinion of God, and thoſe conceits which are by <hi>relation of men,</hi> and not being able at once to diſpoyl himſelf of them, and leaving them by little and little, he goes on by little and little, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that opinion and thoſe conceits of God, which are by the ſpirit of God. Whereupon it comes to paſſe, that it ſeems to him to make ſo many changes in the knowledge of God as thoſe are, which he makes in leaving his old opinion, and his old conceits of God, and in clothing of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99333:78"/> himſelf with a new opinion, and new conceits of God. And becauſe it is alſo more proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the depraved nature of man, to abide in the firſt then in the ſecond, in the old then in the new, in that of Adam then in that of Chriſt, in that of the Law then in that of the Goſpel; I underſtand that with difficulty doth a man ſpoil himſelf of the old, and cloath himſelf with the new. And I underſtand, that to a regenerate man &amp; renued by the holy ſpirit, it appertains to keep his mind all his life long attent to deſpoil himſelf of that opinion, and of thoſe conceits of God which are by <hi>relation of men;</hi> and to cloath himſelf with that opinion, and with thoſe conceits of God, which are by <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the ſpirit of God,</hi> which is obtained by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>THis is certain, that aſſoon as a man being inſpired of God, accepts the covenant of juſtification by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, he begins to die unto the world, and to live unto God, to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99333:80"/> die unto Adam, and to live unto Chriſt, to come out of the kingdome of the world, and to enter into the kingdome of God: And that at that time which a man dies, the ſoul being ſeparated from the body, he doth accompliſh his dying to the world, his dying to Adam, and his coming out of the kingdome of the world; &amp; that when he ſhall riſe again, his ſoul returning to unite it ſelf with the body, he ſhall live perfectly and entirely unto God; he ſhall live unto Chriſt, and ſhall abide in the kingdome of God.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99333:81"/> he himſelf doth by his word, &amp; by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; ſuch as are the Creation of the World, and particularly that of Man; the Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind by Jeſus Chriſt; the Vocation to the participation of this good; Juſtification, with all the other ſpirituall knowledges and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. To this <hi>immediate will</hi> of God, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a man was ſubject in his firſt creation; And I underſtand, that in ſinning, he made himſelf ſubject to the <hi>mediate will</hi> of God. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ſubjection I underſtand all evils do conſiſt, and all troubles, to which our humane nature is ſubject, amongſt which death is a moſt principall one.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe that hath been ſaid, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand two things; the one, that Adam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying God, made us ſubject to <hi>the will</hi> of God which is <hi>mediate,</hi> and thereupon to evils, and to death: And that Chriſt obeying God, returns his to the ſubjection, and to the <hi>will</hi> of God, which is <hi>immediate;</hi> and therefore he frees them from evils and from death; from death he frees them by the Reſurrection, in which they ſhall live an eternall life; and from evils he doth ſometimes free them, cauſing that thoſe ſhould not touch them, which ſhould touch them according to ordinary courſe; at other times depriving them of the feeling of them; and other times mortifying them therewith; In ſuch ſort that the evil is converted into good:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99333:82"/> and as he doth not in ſuch manner free them from death, that they ſhould not dye, but he doth inable and diſpoſe them to a moſt happy and everlaſting life; ſo neither doth he free them from evils, in ſuch ſort, as they ſhould not touch them, but he doth inable and teach them to draw good out of theſe evils.</p>
               <p>The other thing which I underſtand is, that the continuall ſighing of a man, that feels, or begins to feel in himſelf the benefit of Chriſt, ought to be in deſiring and demanding to be freed from the ſubjection of Gods <hi>mediate will,</hi> and return under that <hi>will</hi> which is <hi>immediate.</hi> For God being ſoveraignly good, or rather goodneſſe it ſelf, in that <hi>immediate will</hi> of his there can be nothing but that which is ſuch as he himſelf is. And I think aſſuredly, that Chriſt counſelling his to ſay, <hi>Thy will be done, in earth as it is in heaven,</hi> doth counſell them to have this deſire of which I have ſpoken, and that they ſhould alwayes ſigh in this manner; as if he ſhould have ſaid; Crave of God that he would make you exempt from that ordinary Regiment and government, and make you free from the government of his <hi>mediate will,</hi> and that he would ſet you in that of his <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate will;</hi> in ſuch ſort, that like as the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armies are immediately governed of God, ſo you alſo, that are on earth may be immediately governed of God!</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:99333:82"/>
               <p>Whence I gather, that when a pious perſon ſhall feel himſelf troubled and moleſted in his body, or in his mind; it ſhall be well, that attributing that trouble and moleſtation to the ſubjection of that <hi>will</hi> of God which is <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> he ſhould feel in himſelf the evil of <hi>Adam:</hi> and that deſiring, and ſighing to feel the good of Chriſt, he ſhould ſay to God, <hi>Thy will be done!

They who ſay unto God <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> pretending as is ſaid, to be ſubject to the <hi>will</hi> of God, that is <hi>immediate,</hi> they ſay it with all their mind, they ſay it with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, and they ſay it in that ſenſe which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Saviour intended it ſhould be ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:99333:83"/>
               <p>I do not underſtand, that in that <hi>will</hi> of God which I call <hi>mediate,</hi> there is not a particular providence of God, but I underſtand, that that providence is generall to many perſons, ſuch as is the rain, the ſunne-ſhine, &amp;c. of which things many enjoy their parts. And the <hi>immediate will</hi> I underſtand is a more particular and more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable providence with them who are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſuch as it was in giving us Chriſt, and ſuch as are other favours, which are done more to one then to another; of which ſometimes ſome wicked likewiſe have their part, although that be not Gods principall intent; ſo as when he ſtaid the Sun through Joſhua's prayers, of that favour many wicked had their part, as a man may ſay, by chance; the people of God injoying it much otherwiſe, becauſe they felt the favour of God in it. In this manner a man may diſcourſe through all outward favours, which God doth unto his, of which others likewiſe that are not his, do alwayes injoy ſome part, but they do not know that more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and more favourable providence and <hi>will</hi> of God in them, and ſo as much as concerns them, they are things that come by chance.</p>
               <p>I reſolve therefore my ſelf in this, that ſaying the <hi>mediate will</hi> of God, I underſtand that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall providence of God, which is with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall order, in which alwayes God doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur; and that ſaying the <hi>immediate will</hi> of God,

               </argument>
               <p>IT comes to paſſe that a pious perſon finding himſelf in a dry and diſcontented eſtate, finds himſelf likewiſe without confidence, and as it were an Infidell. And it comes to paſſe that finding himſelf in another eſtate with ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and with joy, and content, he finds himſelf together therewith, full of confidence, and full of faith, whereupon the enemy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind willing to diſturb his felicity, comes to perſwade him that he truſteth and believeth for the good which he finds in himſelf, in ſuch ſort, that he hath confidence in himſelf, and not in God; and it is clean contrary. And therefore the pious perſon finding himſelf in that firſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, ſhall know and underſtand what he is of himſelf, what his own being is, and the being which he hath from Adam; and ſhall think, becauſe he hath at other times felt the favour of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99333:85"/> God, he feels in that eſtate his disfavour; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as none ever feels the disfavour, but he that hath felt the favour: and ſo thinking ſhall aſſure himſelf of his election, of his vocation, and predeſtination, and ſhall ſay, The ſame God, who without my deſert hath at other times fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me, ſhall draw me out of his disfavour, and return me unto his favour again.</p>
               <p>When a pious perſon ſhall find himſelf in the <hi>eſtate of proſperity,</hi> he ſhall know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which he is through God, and the being which he hath from God, and the being which he hath through Chriſt, and ſhall know in himſelf the preſence of God, unto which he ſhall attribute his loving, his confidence, his believing, and his hope; knowing that they are all the gifts of God, having already known what he is of himſelf, what he is without God.</p>
               <p>In this manner knowing himſelf in that firſt eſtate deprived of the preſence of God, and knowing God in the ſecond ſtate, and being rich by the preſence of God; he ſhall much augment himſelf in the knowledge of himſelf, and in the knowledge of God: and this, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>is all that belongs to a man.</hi> He would ſay that herein conſiſteth all his being, and all the perfection of a man, that he ſhould know that his being and his perfection comes from God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>FOraſmuch as I underſtand that amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things with which the evil Spirit diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets and moleſts the thoughts of perſons applyed unto piety, one is to perſwade them, that the knowledge which they have of God, and of Chriſt, and that underſtanding of the ſpirituall things of the holy Spirit, is not gotten by them through Revelation, or inward Inſpiration, (as they obtain it who are elected of God, and as it ought to be, to the intent, that that bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which our Saviour pronounced S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſed,</hi> may reach unto them;) but by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, by Judgement, and by humane induſtry, as thoſe men obtain it, who are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected of God, and therefore are neither held, nor called <hi>bleſſed.</hi> And becauſe underſtanding this, I deſire that they who know God and Chriſt by the holy ſpirit, ſhould underſtand their good and their felicity, I ſay, that every <hi>pious perſon,</hi> and juſt by the Juſtice executed on Chriſt, being tempted with ſuch imaginations &amp; perſwaſions, ſhould firſt <hi>hold it certain, that if his piety and juſtification were not the work of the holy Spirit, he ſhould not be tempted with ſuch imaginations, nor with ſuch perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> For <hi>fleſh is</hi> never contrary unto fleſh, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:99333:86"/> it is alwayes <hi>contrary to the ſpirit.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evil ſpirit, who, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſeeks ill thoughts,</hi> ſerving himſelf of the enmity that is between the fleſh &amp; the holy Spirit, doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Spirit with ſuch imaginations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions.

               </argument>
               <p>I Conſider, that when a <hi>perſon would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the profit that he hath made in mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> that is, what affections and appetites he hath mortified, he ſhall know it by examining himſelf throughly, what affections and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites he hath found alive in himſelf having been tempted by them. And conſidering what, and which of them are now dead and mortified, <hi>he ſhall underſtand what profit he hath made in mortification.</hi> For I underſtand, that he who hath never felt the ſhame to ſpeak of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Chriſt, hath not mortified the affection of ſhame, which is proper and naturall unto man: and he that hath felt the ſhame, and now no more feels it, he it is that hath mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had mortified it, as he ſhews, ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>he was not aſhamed to preach the Goſpel.</hi> And I underſtand; that if he had never been aſhamed, he would never have gloried in not being aſhamed. In like manner I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that none hath mortified the affection of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99333:87"/> the honour of the world, and of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſteem, but he that having been tempted thereunto, and having combated with it, is now no more tempted. This ſelf ſame I underſtand of the affections of anger, of envy, of hatred, and of revenge, as I likewiſe underſtand it of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall appetites: Underſtanding that none hath mortified the carnall appetite, but he that having been tempted by it, and having combated with it, is no more tempted and overcome with it. This ſelf ſame I underſtand of that appetite, which delights to ſee things that pleaſe the eyes, and to eat things, that pleaſe the taſte, and to heare vain things and matters of the world, and to ſmell delicate things; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that he onely may ſay, that he is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in theſe appetites, who having been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted and moleſted by them, and having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with them, is now reduced to ſuch terms, that either he feels them not, or is ſo much maſter of them, that with eaſe he overcomes them, when ever they moleſt him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none dies, but he that hath lived, it being neceſſary, that in them who are to be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, all that which is according to the fleſh, ſhould die, as well touching affections as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, I underſtand, that all this being to die in the regenerated, it is the work of God, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently when a man ſets himſelf to pietie, he ſhould be moleſted and tempted, not onely from
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99333:87"/> thoſe affections and appetites, with which he was formerly tempted, but moreover with others, which he never before felt, being different, yea and very ſtrange ones; to the intent that feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them alive he may kill them, and killing them, his regeneration ſhould be made perfect, as appertains to them that are members of the Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whence the fear of death proceeds in pious perſons, and that it is a ſigne of Predestination for a man to content himſelf that there ſhould he another life.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WIlling to underſtand whence it proceeds, that many eſtranged from piety have vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offered themſelves unto <hi>Death,</hi> and have willed and deſired it; and many pious are grieved, and much reſent the remembrance of <hi>Death,</hi> not being able to reduce themſelves to be content to die; which according to humane reaſon ought to be clean contrary; becauſe they who are eſtranged from piety either do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the other life, or are doubtfull of it, or do no think to be happy in it; and they who are pious, believe the other life, and are very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it, and are aſſured that they ſhall be happy in it. I think this, that amongſt them who are eſtranged from piety, ſome do not fear <hi>death</hi> for ſome opinions whereof they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded; and others becauſe they hold it for a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99333:88"/> point of valour not to fear it; and others love <hi>death,</hi> believing that they ſhall get fame by dying; and others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it is troubleſome, and painfull unto them to live in neceſſity, or diſhonour; wherein they do as the ſick-patient, that puts himſelf into hazard of running into a greater ſickneſſe through deſire of coming out of that leſſe which he feels. In all theſe I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own raſhneſſe, folly, and impatience. Moreover I think, that amongſt the <hi>pious that fear death,</hi> ſome fear it becauſe they are not throughly <hi>confirmed in piety,</hi> nor throughly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of that Juſtice, by which eternall life is obtained; others fear it through <hi>naturall inſtinct,</hi> it being Gods doing that men ſhould fear <hi>Death,</hi> and love life, to the intent they may preſerve themſelves in life; and others fear it, in as much as it is given to men in puniſhment of their ſinne, it being Gods doing, that a man ſhould feel as a puniſhment that which is given him as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by generall ſentence, which belongs to every man, as indeed the evil of originall ſinne belongs to every man.</p>
               <p>In every of theſe I know pietie, juſtice, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, albeit, in the firſt I know weakneſſe and infirmity; as I alſo account it a great weakneſſe in thoſe pious perſons, who without feeling any inward inſpiration, that God would have them to die, do deſire, and love <hi>Death:</hi> for this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is not free from ſome branch of impatience,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99333:88"/> like unto that of them who are ſtrangers from piety.</p>
               <p>Whence I take this reſolution, that foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in them who are ſtrangers from piety, the not fearing of death proceeds from raſhneſſe, folly, and impatience; and the fearing of death in the pious proceeds from piety, juſtice, and holineſſe; that neither the ſtranger from piety hath cauſe to exalt himſelf, when he fears not <hi>death,</hi> nor the pious hath cauſe to be ſorrowfull, when he finds himſelf fearfull of <hi>death:</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this fear proceeds from his own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmity; or from his want of faith and aſſurance of life eternall; or it comes to him by naturall inclination; or it comes to him through ſence of the puniſhment of ſinne, which is <hi>effectuall</hi> in all them that appertain to the people of God, yea even when themſelves think it not ſo. Whereupon if a man ſhall ſay, that Chriſt having ſatisfied for originall ſinne, they who are his members ought not to feel the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of death, I ſhall ſay unto him, that Chriſt did not revoke that ſentence given againſt us, whereby we are all obliged to <hi>death,</hi> but that he remedied it by his reſurrection, in ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ort as we die by Adam, and ſhall riſe again by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I alſo take another reſolution, that is, that a pious perſon doth then content himſelf to die as <hi>pious,</hi> when by his death the glory of God is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99333:89"/> illuſtrated, as the Chriſtian Martyrs did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves: alſo when it is Gods will that he ſhould die; for then as I underſtand, God gives him contentedneſſe and willingneſſe to die, in ſuch ſort, as when a pious perſon feels in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſtrong fear of <hi>death,</hi> not being able to bring himſelf to be content to die, he may hold for certain, that God will not at that time take him out of this life. And he ought to think that as long as he fears death, the naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the puniſhment of ſinne work their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in him, and ſo he will not be grieved, nor account himſelf leſſe in piety for this matter. They that are ſtrangers from piety, when they leaſt fear <hi>death,</hi> and when they have moſt brought themſelves to be contented with it, if they would ſpeak truth, will confeſſe that if it were in their power, they would not that there ſhould be any other life; for they are not certain to be happy therein. And they who are pious, when they moſt fear <hi>death,</hi> ſpeaking the truth will confeſſe, that they would not be contented that there were no other life; feeling within themſelves that God hath not created them for this life, but for another. And for a man to be thus not contented with this life onely, as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, is a great counterſigne to be <hi>aſſured</hi> of his piety, and of his <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> For I hold for certain, that to them to whom God means to give eternall life, he doth alſo put a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99333:89"/> great love and great affection of it into their hearts, in ſuch ſort, that he who ſhall find in his minde a deſire that there were no other life, let him hold himſelf impious, although he would chooſe to die, but let him not deſpair: for albeit he be in impiety at preſent, yet he ought to think that God is able to draw him out of it, as he hath drawn, and doth draw all them that have been, and are pious. And he who ſhall find in his mind a love of eternall life, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf with this preſent, may hold himſelf for pious, and for <hi>predeſtinated unto life everlaſting,</hi> although he <hi>fear death;</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all this which hath been ſaid, and above all, that even the onely begotten Sonne of God <hi>feared death,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>The <hi>first counterſigne</hi> is, <hi>The great affection to ſpirituall things, being delighted in them, and exerciſing them with favour and zeal.</hi> And I call ſpirituall things all thoſe things which are properly of the holy ſpirit, and are inward and divine, ſuch as are the reading of holy Scripture, diſcourſes of holy things, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall prayer, and continuall adoration in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99333:92"/> ſpirit, that is, for a man to be contented with what ever God doth, holding it for holy, and for juſt, and for good, as much as the frailty of the fleſh permits.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Counterſigne</hi> is, <hi>The totall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring of all thoſe converſations, and of all thoſe readings of men, and of books, in which there is no part of the holy ſpirit to be ſeen.</hi> For I underſtand, that a man that hath truly taſted the converſation, and the reading of thoſe perſons, and of thoſe books, in which the holy ſpirit is, cannot taſt other men, and other books; that if he do reliſh them, it is a ſigne he hath not taſted thoſe other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third counter-ſigne</hi> is, <hi>To approve the things of the holy Spirit, the conceits, and the knowledges, and the apprehenſions, that are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the holy ſpirit, and that with the mind, and not with the wit.</hi> Humane wiſdome doth ſometimes approve ſpirituall things not with the mind, but with the wit and by opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not by inward ſenſe. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that a man that hath the inward feeling, doth eaſily know when one approves them with his mind and when with his wit.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Counter-ſigne</hi> is, <hi>The Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the mind, and of the body; of the mind in all the affections that are according to the world, (amongſtwhich I put eſpecialy cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, in what way ſoever it come palliated,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99333:93"/> and adorned, and of the body, in all the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites that are according to the fleſh.</hi> Humane wiſdome approves and teacheth mortification; but however much it approve and teach it, there never was yet, nor never ſhall be man, that without the Chriſtian ſpirit, I would ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remaining incorporated in Chriſt, can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in ſuch ſort that it may not be eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by him that ſhall in part have got it by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. And therefore I reſolve my ſelf in this, that pious and Chriſtian perſons may ſecurely admit unto their converſation and acquaintance, <hi>thoſe men whom they ſhall ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned unto ſpirituall things; drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and diſenamoured from thoſe things in which the holy ſpirit hath no part; and thoſe of whom they ſhall ſee the things of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be approved; and in whom they ſhall ſee true mortification:</hi> holding for certain, that humane wiſdome and hamane craft cannot feigne, or diſſemble in all theſe things, although it may in ſome of them; which may be eaſily diſcovered by pious perſons, to whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to uſe the <hi>ſerpentine wiſdome,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that making uſe of theſe <hi>four counter ſignes,</hi> they ſhall know thoſe who come unto them <hi>making ſhew of ſheep, being indeed wolves,</hi> and ſo doing they ſhall make uſe of that help which Jeſus Chriſt our Lord gives.</p>

                  <p>That he who prayes, and works, and understands, doth then pray, work, and underſtand, as he ought, when he is inſpired to pray to work, and to underſtand.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SAint Paul, in the eight to the Romanes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands that <hi>Prayer</hi> is one of thoſe things, wherein in our weakneſſes, and infirmities we are favoured of God, and helped by the Spirit of God: And ſo he ſaith, <hi>That we not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to pray as we ought, the Spirit of God prayeth for us.</hi> Whereby I underſtand, that then the holy <hi>Spirit prayes for us,</hi> when it moves us to <hi>pray,</hi> for then it <hi>prayes in us.</hi> And I underſtand that he who <hi>prayes with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> demands that which is the will of God, and ſo he doth obtain what he will. And he who <hi>prayes with his own ſpirit,</hi> demands that which is his own will, wherein conſiſteth the not knowing neither what, nor how we ought to pray.</p>
               <p>Mans mind is preſumptuous and arrogant; and not willing to yield, that it knows not what or how it <hi>ought to pray,</hi> ſaith, I will crave of God that he ſhould do his own will, and ſo I cannot erre: and doth not conſider, that to <hi>pray</hi> in this manner, comes becauſe a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe, and that peradventure it would not go well with him, nor is convenient for him, that God ſhould do his will: as it was
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:99333:94"/> not convenient for <hi>Hezekias,</hi> when death was intimated unto him; and that he doth not know how he ſhall content himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form with the will of God. But man not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give himſelf as overcome, no not by this neither, ſaith, I will demand of God, that he would cauſe that I ſhould content my ſelf with that which ſhall be his will, and ſo I ſhall be ſure to hit the mark; and doth not conſider that oftentimes it is better for a man not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf, nor to conform himſelf with Gods will: as it was better for <hi>Hezekias,</hi> and as it is better for thoſe perſons, who by grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and reſenting himſelf for that which God doth, come to reacknowledge themſelves, and to know God, and to humble themſelves, and to exalt God; in ſuch ſort, as will they, nill they, mans mind is forced to confeſſe that which Saint Paul ſaith, that <hi>we know not what, nor how we ought to pray.</hi> And he who confeſſeth this, underſtanding from the ſelf Saint Paul, that <hi>the ſpirit of God prayes for us,</hi> and in us, will apply himſelf to pray God, that he would give him his Spirit to <hi>pray for him,</hi> and in him. When he that <hi>prayes</hi> by humane Spirit, ſaith thoſe words of the <hi>Pater noſter, Thy will be done,</hi> albeit they be words ſpoken with the Spirit of God, he doth not pray with the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> becauſe he doth not pray being <hi>inſpired,</hi> but taught. And Saint Paul doth not
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:99333:94"/> ſay, That <hi>the holy Spirit teacheth us to pray,</hi> but that he <hi>prayes by us, and that he prayes in us.</hi> I will adde this, That they who <hi>pray with their own ſpirit,</hi> when they obtain that which they demand in <hi>prayer,</hi> they feel in their minds a contentedneſſe mixed with pride, and with ſelf eſtimation; and they who <hi>pray with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit,</hi> obtaining that which they demand in their prayers, feel a moſt exceſſive concent, mingled with humility, and with mortification. And I hold that theſe feelings are ſufficient to give a perſon intire knowledge, whether he <hi>pray</hi> with his <hi>own Spirit,</hi> or with the <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> It is very true, that in caſe a man have never <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the holy Spirit,</hi> he cannot make this difference. <hi>Cornelius</hi> prayed with the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> before Saint <hi>Peter</hi> went to his houſe, yet he did not underſtand, that he <hi>prayed with the holy Spirit;</hi> but he underſtood it afterward, when by Saint <hi>Peters</hi> means he had obtained of God <hi>even more then he deſired.</hi> I mean not, more then the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which <hi>prayed by him,</hi> and in him, but more then <hi>Cornelius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deſired in his own mind; in ſuch ſort, that oftentimes the <hi>Spirit of God prayes in us, and by us,</hi> without our knowledge that it is the holy <hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>prayeth,</hi> and what that thing is, which in <hi>prayer</hi> is demanded. The ſame I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand in <hi>working,</hi> as in <hi>prayer:</hi> for S. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe puts them for <hi>gifts of the holy Spirit,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99333:95"/> to miniſter,</hi> that is, to do ſervice to <hi>our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and the exerciſe of charity.</hi> And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that becauſe we do not know how, nor when to <hi>work,</hi> God gives us his <hi>Spirit</hi> that ſhould work in us.</p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome, that alwayes oppoſeth it ſelf to the Spirit of God, pretends to know how to <hi>work,</hi> and when it doth <hi>work</hi> it <hi>works</hi> for its own benefit, it <hi>works</hi> for its own glory, and for its own ſatisfaction, and not purely for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his <hi>neighbour,</hi> nor for Gods glory, nor for the ſatisfaction of them that love God, and therefore it knoweth not how, nor when it ought to <hi>work.</hi> On the contrary, the <hi>Spirit of God works for the profit of our neighbour,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of them that love God, and it works for the glory of God. When he that <hi>works by humane Spirit</hi> imitateth the works of holy men, and follows the doctrine of the Saints, I do not underſtand that he <hi>works with the holy Spirit,</hi> but with his own ſpirit, becauſe he doth not work being <hi>inſpired,</hi> but <hi>taught:</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That <hi>it is a gift of the holy Spirit, to work by the holy Spirit.</hi> They who <hi>work</hi> with humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, find content in their own <hi>works,</hi> mingled with arrogancy, and with preſumption: And they who <hi>work with the holy Spirit,</hi> find likewiſe content in their own <hi>works,</hi> but moſt different, and mingled with humility, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99333:95"/> mortification. In ſuch ſort, as a perſon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining his mind after he hath wrought, may by this conſideration underſtand, whether it be humane wiſdome that hath wrought in him, or the Spirit of God. It is very true, that he who hath never wrought with the Spirit of God, cannot make this difference. In <hi>Cornelius</hi> I conſider the ſame in his <hi>working,</hi> as I have done in his <hi>Prayer:</hi> He did <hi>work with the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> but he did not underſtand that it was the <hi>holy Spirit;</hi> and he underſtood it when he ſaw and felt in himſelf that which aroſe from his working. And between that which <hi>Cornelius wrought; and prayed with the holy Spirit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew Chriſt, and received the holy <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and that which he prayed, and wrought with the holy Spirit, after that he had known Chriſt, and received the holy Spirit; I make this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that at the firſt <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>working</hi> he did not underſtand that he <hi>prayed and wrought by the holy Spirit.</hi> That which I underſtand in <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>working,</hi> I underſtand like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>acknowledgements</hi> of God, and in the underſtanding of holy Scripture, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſets alſo theſe underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings for gifts of the holy Ghoſt; underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that humane wiſdome not knowing how to underſtand the things of the Spirit of God, God gives his ſpirit unto them who are his, to the intent he may teach them thoſe things. Mans
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99333:96"/> mind is proud and haughty in this point, as in all others; whereupon putting it ſelf before the holy Spirit, it goes helping it ſelf as much as it may, to gain by its own underſtanding and judgement the knowledge of God, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Scriptures. And it is a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, that how much the more it labours therein, ſo much more it diſenables it ſelf, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and underſtanding the things of God, and of the ſpirit of God, in a contrary ſenſe, and by the contrary. They who underſtand and know the holy Spirit, by how much more they apply themſelves to underſtand and know, by ſo much do they know and underſtand the more. When as he who knows and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the things of God, goes about to do it with his own wit, and judgement, albeit he do underſtand that which the Saints have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, yet I do not underſtand, that he knows and underſtands with the holy Spirit, but with humane wiſedome; underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as being taught, and not <hi>inſpired.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes it to be a <hi>gift of the holy ſpirit to know the holy ſpirit.</hi> He who knows and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands the things of God, with his own wit and judgement, finds the ſame ſatisfaction that he finds in other knowledges, and in other underſtandings of humane things, and of the writings of men; and with this ſatisfaction looking upon it, he feels pride and ſelf-eſteem
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99333:96"/> in his own mind. And he that underſtands and knows with the holy ſpirit, finds in that which he knows and underſtands, moſt different ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from, that which he finds in thoſe other things, which he knows and underſtands; and finds in his mind, humility, and mortification; in ſuch ſort, that by the feeling which a perſon finds in his own mind, when he ſhall have got a knowledge of God, and when he ſhall have underſtood a place of holy Scripture, he may judge if he have gained that knowledge, and that underſtanding with his wit, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or with the ſpirit of God. If ſo be the feeling ſhall be of pride, and of ſelf eſteem; judging that what he hath known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to be by his own wit and judgement, he ſhall not ſtabliſh himſelf therein: And if the feeling ſhall be of humility, and mortification, judging that what he hath known, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to be by the holy ſpirit, he ſhall ſtabliſh himſelf in it. It is very true, that he who hath never known, nor underſtood with the holy ſpirit, cannot make this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>From theſe three conſiderations I come to take this reſolution, that as well to <hi>pray</hi> as is meet, as to <hi>work,</hi> and to <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>understand,</hi> ſo for all other things alſo, in which we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our ſelves with our minds, or with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in this preſent life, we have need of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99333:97"/> government of the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> without which, although it be grievous to us, we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that <hi>we know not to pray as we ought,</hi> nor to work as we ought, nor to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand as we ought. With this confeſſion we ſhall alwayes demand of God his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he ſhall give it us through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whence it proceeds, that humane wiſdome will not attribute all things to God: and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they ought to be attributed to him.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr <hi>three Cauſes</hi> I underſtand it, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived by the judgement of humane wiſdome, <hi>will not confeſſe that every thing comes from God.</hi> The firſt is, that they might not deprive themſelves of the merits of their own good works, underſtanding that they ſhould deprive themſelves of them, when <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſhould be attributed to God;</hi> inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as in their good works, the goodneſſe of God would be that which was to be conſidered, and not that of men.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Cauſe I underſtand is, becauſe men judging of good works with the ſelf ſame judgement, with which they judge their own proper works, they hold that for evil in God, which they would hold for evil in evil men:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99333:97"/> And it ſeeming to them an evil and abſurd thing to <hi>attribute any evil</hi> thing to God, who is ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignly good, and is goodneſſe it ſelf, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve that they will not <hi>attribute every thing to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third Cauſe,</hi> as I underſtand, is becauſe they think that if men believed that God did all things, they would become diſſolute in their lives, licentious, vitious, and inſolent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in ſuccouring, helping, and favouring their neighbours; every man ſaying of himſelf, If I live ill, it is becauſe it pleaſeth God that I ſhould live ſo, and he himſelf when it ſo ſeems good to him, will make me to live well; and ſaying of their neighbour, If ſuch a one be nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, tribulated, and afflicted, it is becauſe it ſo pleaſeth God, and when it ſhall pleaſe God that he ſhould not be ſo, he will draw him out of neceſſity, and out of tribulation, and out of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and therefore it is not neceſſary that I ſhould meddle therewith.</p>
               <p>To theſe <hi>three Cauſes</hi> or reaſons of humane wiſdome I underſtand that a man may fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in this manner. To the <hi>firſt,</hi> that if men knew themſelves, they would know in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves rebellion, iniquity, and ſinne, and in their works ſelf-love and ſelf-intereſt, and ſo they would not pretend to obtain merit through their own works; and not pretending it, the firſt cauſe of impiety would be taken away, in which
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99333:98"/> they do eaſily fall that are in the eyes of the world juſt and holy: for they properly are thoſe that ſeek merit in their works. From this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency they are free, who knowing the being and the nature of man, renounce their own merits, cleaving onely to the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>ſecond Cauſe</hi> and reaſon it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that if ſo be it ſeem to men an abſurd and evil thing, that God ſhould harden the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> making him to ſinne in <hi>not ſuffering the people of God to depart;</hi> and that God ſhould command <hi>Shimei,</hi> that he ſhould ſinne by <hi>curſing David;</hi> and that God ſhould make them to ſinne, to whom the Scripture ſaith <hi>he gave the ſpirit of errour,</hi> and that he ſhould ordain that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould ſinne by <hi>ſelling Chriſt;</hi> and that God ſhould blind them of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> (Rom. 1.) ſpeaks, that <hi>they ſhould fall into filthy and abominable ſinnes:</hi> And if likewiſe it ſeem an abſurd and evil thing to men, that which God doth to many men in the world, it is not becauſe the things are in themſelves abſurd and evil, but becauſe they are works of the holy Spirit; and men judging with humane wiſdome, with which they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the divine ſecret that is in them, come to judge falſely of them; being herein towards God, as raſh men are towards their Princes, judging evil of them; when for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99333:98"/> and for the common profit, they do ſomething which turns to the damage of ſome particular, not conſidering the intent which the Prince hath in ſuch like things. For if they did conſider and underſtand, they would judge well of thoſe things, and of the Princes that do them. I ſay in the ſame manner raſh men, becauſe they underſtand not the intent which God hath in his works, they judge them evil, and then pretending piety, they will not attribute them to God; but if they did know and underſtand the intent that God hath in thoſe things which they judge evil, they would hold and judge them for good; and ſo they would not come to deprive God of his particular providence in every thing. And certainly if theſe men did conſider, that God hardening the heart of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> that <hi>he ſhould ſinne, not letting Gods people go,</hi> did intend to illuſtrate his glory, and to make manifeſt his power in favouring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they would account the <hi>hardneſſe of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs heart</hi> amongſt the works of Gods mercy; foraſmuch as that which the people of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, was thereby effected: and the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they would make of the <hi>curſes of Shimei;</hi> and of <hi>Judas</hi> his <hi>ſelling Chriſt;</hi> and of the ſins of them of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the firſt of the Romans; and they would make the ſame judgement in all the works of men, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attribute them all unto God, ſearching
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99333:99"/> out the ſecret judgement that is in them, even as pious perſons ſearch them out, to whom it oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that they hold ſomething of their own or others for an errour, becauſe they know not the intent that God hath in it; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by time knowing the intent that God had in it, they hold it for a very good thing. And to the ſame perſons it oftentimes befalls, that they hold a thing for well done, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by tract of time they know was ill done. This ſometimes happens to them, when they ſtand not very attent to conſider the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God; and ſometimes, becauſe it doth not pleaſe God that they ſhould underſtand that which he intends in his works; as perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture it did not pleaſe him that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhould underſtand that which he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>hardneſſe of Pharaohs heart,</hi> to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould not ceaſe to be very inſtant, that he <hi>would let the people of God to go out.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſeems, that mans piety conſiſteth in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his mind to underſtand that which God intends in his works, eſpecially in thoſe which ſeem abſurd and evil; and to reverence and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thoſe which he doth not underſtand, holding them all for holy juſt and good.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>third cauſe</hi> and reaſon which men find, not to confeſſe that God doth all things, it may be effectually and by our own experience anſwered, That thoſe men who believe and hold
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99333:99"/> for certain that. God doth all things; for this ſelf-ſame cauſe that they abide in this certainty, are pious and juſt; and being pious and juſt, are in themſelves moſt temperate, and moſt modeſt, and are towards their neighbours moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, moſt diligent, and moſt liberall; inaſmuch is piety &amp; juſtice do mortifie in them the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of ſenſuality, that might make them viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inſolent, as alſo the affections of the mind that might make them intereſſed and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of themſelves, and conſequently remiſſe with their neighbours. This mortification in them proceeding partly from that union which they hold in their hearts with God, never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting God, and principally from that incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration with which they ſtand incorporated in the death of Chriſt, who killing his own fleſh on the Croſſe, did likewiſe kill the fleſh of all them, who believing in him are made his members. And they who remain in this, never come to excuſe their licentious lives in the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of their minds, ſaying, It pleaſeth God they ſhould be ſo; nay rather, finding in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any vice, and finding in their minds any livelineſſe to the fleſh or to the world, they know the reliques of their own iniquity, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and ſinne, and demand of God that he would mortifie them in them, as he hath mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the reſt: nor do they ever become remiſſe in helping and favouring their neighbours; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99333:100"/> inaſmuch as the affections that are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh, and humane wiſdome dying in them, and thoſe which are according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reviving, they do not move with an anxious affection of the fleſh, but are moved with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate deſire of the ſpirit:<note n="*" place="margin">In indifferent things there is room for notions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting of them; but in things good as to relieve my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, God hath already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will about it: therefore we ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, except there be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining motion (as S. Paul had) when he would have preached in Aſia. And I conceive that reſtraining motions are much more frequent to the godly, then inviting motions; becauſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture invites enough; for it invites us to all good, according to that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular place, Phil 4.8. a man is to embrace all good; but becauſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do all, God often chooſeth which he ſhall do, and that by reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from what he would not have him do.</note> and inaſmuch as they do not feel in themſelves any motion to help and ſuccour their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they know that God will have it ſo.</p>
               <p>This I ſay, becauſe thoſe perſons that ſtand in this piety, keeping good account with their inward motions, hold thoſe to be wills of the fleſh, which are not according to that which they know to be the will of God. And they hold thoſe to be the will of the ſpirit, which they know to be conformed to the will of God; making this judgement by that which is the du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of piety, and that which is the due of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by that which the holy Scriptures both New and Old teach; and ſtanding attent here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, they overcome the motions which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, and execute thoſe which are according to the ſpirit. And albeit they
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99333:100"/> have their imperfections by Gods will; yet their deſire is to become perfect. And although they hold the ſufferings of their neighbour to be the will of God, they hold likewiſe their motions to help and favour them, to be the will of God; and knowing in their own imperfections, and in the ſufferings of their neighbours the will of God which is with wrath, and knowing in their own deſires of perfection, and in their motions to ſuccour their neighbours, the will of God which is with mercy; loving the will which is with mercy, and flying from that which is with wrath, they do attend unto perfection, and do attend to ſuccour their neighbours.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid that which moveth men not to <hi>attribute all things to God,</hi> and that which may be anſwered unto it, now I will ſay that which I think thereabout, remitting my ſelf to more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſpirituall judgement.</p>
               <p>In God I conſider two wills, as at other times I have conſidered it; one Mediate, inaſmuch as it works by theſe which we call ſecond cauſes: and the other Immediate, inaſmuch as it works by it ſelf. Unto the Mediate I underſtand men ſtand ſubject through originall ſinne; and from the Mediate I underſtand that men are exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and freed by regeneration, but in a certain manner.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, that in a mans avoiding thoſe things which by this Mediate will might do him harm,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99333:101"/> and in chooſing thoſe things which by the ſelf ſame might do him good, a mans freewill doth conſiſt; I mean, in all thoſe things which are outward and bodily, not in thoſe things which appertain to virtuous or vitious living. To the <hi>Immediate</hi> will of God I underſtand gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all men are ſubject, God working in them, in ſome with love, in others with hatred, in ſome with wrath, in others with mercy, in ſome with favours, in others with disfavour. And this will of God I underſtand is that unto which S. Paul ſaith, <hi>men cannot make reſistance;</hi> and this I underſtand that God uſeth illuſtrating his glory, and ſhewing his omnipotency in them that are his, in ſuch ſort, that in this Will of God there are <hi>two parts,</hi> or <hi>two wills,</hi> one of <hi>hatred,</hi> of <hi>wrath,</hi> and <hi>disfavour,</hi> and the other of <hi>love,</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>favour.</hi> The firſt, as I underſtand, fell upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> upon <hi>Shimei,</hi> and upon them, to whom God gave the <hi>ſpirit of errour,</hi> and upon <hi>Judas,</hi> and upon thoſe whom God delivered over to a <hi>reprobate ſenſe.</hi> And this ſelf-ſame I underſtand fell upon all thoſe which are <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> as was <hi>Nero,</hi> and as all they have been and are, and ſhall be, who with malignity perſecute the Chriſtian ſpirit in thoſe who are the members of Chriſt. All theſe as I underſtand, do the will of God without underſtanding themſelves that this is the will of God. For if they did underſtand it, they would
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:99333:101"/> ceaſe to be impious, and they would be pious. That will of God which is of love, of mercy, and favour. I underſtand it in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and in the Saints of the Law, and I underſtand in it S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and in the Martyrs, and likewiſe in all thoſe who are called of God to the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, all which I underſtand do fulfill the will of God; for herein conſiſteth pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. And I underſtand, that neither<note n="*" place="margin">This Doctrine howſoever it is true in ſubſtance, yet it requireth diſcreet and wary explaining.</note> 
                  <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> nor <hi>Judas,</hi> nor thoſe who are <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> could ceaſe to be ſuch: nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor thoſe who are <hi>veſſels of mercy;</hi> in ſuch manner, that <hi>Judas could not forbear to ſell Chriſt, nor S. Paul could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to preach Chriſt.</hi> Finally, I underſtand, that in thoſe things which are done in the world by Gods <hi>mediate will,</hi> they who are <hi>veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath,</hi> know the naturall order, and know the goodneſſe or malignity of men. And I underſtand, that in the ſame things they who are the <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> know in the naturall order the will of God, who ſet this order; and in that which is or ſeems to be goodneſſe or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of men, they know with the will of God, the goodneſſe and malice of men. In the ſame manner I underſtand, that in thoſe things which are done by the <hi>immediate will of God,</hi> they who are impious do know onely their own
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99333:102"/> wills, and the wills of thoſe that do them: and I underſtand that in the ſame things they who are pious, know the will of God, <hi>attributing all things to God,</hi> conſidering in thoſe who are the veſſels of wrath, as were <hi>Pharaoh, Shimei, Judas,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> the will of God with wrath, with hatred, and with disfavour; and knowing in them who are <hi>veſſels of mercy,</hi> as thoſe of the Hebrew people, and thoſe of the Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the will of God with love, with mercy, and with favour. And in this manner without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injury to God, without depraving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and without looſing charity; nay rather, illuſtrating the glory of God, mortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and growing in charity, they come to believe that God doth all things, ſome with his mediate will, and others with his immediate will; ſome as in veſſels of hatred, of wrath, and disfavour; and others as in veſſels of love, of mercy, and favour. And thoſe are they, who amongſt all men are pious, knowing God, and are juſt, knowing the Son of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

And knowing by teſtimony of holy Scripture, that for the ſinne of the firſt man, from that firſt perfect being, and that being like unto God, man is come to this imperfect being, and like unto the being of other animals, inaſmuch as pertains to his body, and to the being of evil ſpirits as touching his ſoul; I come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the evil which is come to mankind by the ſinne of the firſt man, conſiſts in this, that of impaſſible he is become paſſible, ſubject to cold, and to hear, to hunger, and to thirſt, with all other corporall incommodities; and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal he is become mortal, ſubject unto death; and of wiſe he is become ignorant; of juſt, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; of mercifull, vindicative; of faithfull, falſe; and of true, a lier. Whereby I underſtand, that becauſe the evil into which mankind fel through
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99333:103"/> ſinne, toucheth men in their bodies and in their minds, the grace which God hath pleaſed to do unto mankind by means of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, appertains likewiſe both to bodies and to minds; and ſo it is, that aſſoon as a man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God, and doth accept for his the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt; being made a member of Chriſt, he begins to be partaker of that firſt <hi>reparation,</hi> which is of the mind, and is by the death of Chriſt. And it is alſo true, that that man who ſhall depart from this life a member of Chriſt, ſhall be partaker of the laſt <hi>reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> which ſhall be of the body, and ſhall be by the reſurrection of Chriſt, and ſhall be in the generall reſurrection of all men; in ſuch ſort, as they who are members of Chriſt, by the death of Chriſt do repair the evil of their minds in this preſent life, if not altogether, yet in part; and they do repair by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt the evil of their body in life everlaſting, and then ſhall they have recovered intirely that image, and that ſimilitude of God with which they were created, being in their bodies impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and immortall, and being in their minds juſt, wiſe, mercifull, faithfull, and true, in which I underſtand our whole felicity doth conſiſt.</p>
               <p>After that I have underſtood all this, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve my ſelf, that the proper exerciſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in this preſent life, is to attend unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of his mind, and to recover the image
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99333:103"/> and ſimilitude of God, with which he was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. And albeit, as I have ſaid, ſo much of this is recovered as there is (as a man may ſay) of the incorporation in the death of Chriſt in a man; nevertheleſſe I underſtand it appertains to a Chriſtian to exerciſe himſelf to recover it in this manner: When he ſhall be ſolicited by the depravation of his mind unto impiety, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelf that God is juſt, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it belongs to be juſt, and not impious. When he ſhall be ſolicited unto revenge, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelf that God is mercifull, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it appertains to be mercifull, and not vindicative. When he ſhall be ſolicited unto wrath, remembring himſelf that God is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it appertains to be patient, and not wrathfull. When he ſhall be ſolicited to falſity and lies, remembring himſelf that God is faithfull and true, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it appertains to be faithfull and true. When he ſhall be ſolicited to deſire to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prized of the men of this world, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring himſelf that God is a pilgrim and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this preſent life, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it appertains to be a pilgrim and ſtranger with God, that I may be altogether like unto God. And finally, when he ſhall be ſolicited to any thing, which may redound to the hurt of his neighbour in any ſort whatſoever, remembring himſelf that God loves men ſo much, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:99333:104"/> their evil and damage, in which they were thrown down headlong, he gave his own Son unto death, he ſhall ſay, No, to me it appertains to have love and charity. And ſo running through all thoſe things, with which a man may be ſolicited by his own affections through the <hi>depravation</hi> of the mind, he ſhall find perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God, with which he may repreſſe them; and ſo by little and little he ſhall go on, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting in himſelf the reparation of his mind, which is the firſt thing, and he ſhall go every houre more perfecting the reparation of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the laſt. And in this exerciſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Christian perfection conſiſteth.</hi> I would ſay, that ſo much is a Chriſtian more or leſſe perfect in this life, inaſmuch as occupying himſelf in this exerciſe, he doth obtain more or leſſe of that part which is to be gotten in this preſent life, of the image and likeneſſe of God, with which he was created.

               </argument>
               <p>HAving oftentimes ſaid, that to thoſe perſons who are entred into the kingdome of God, accepting the grace of the Goſpel, God makes them to <hi>feel his preſence,</hi> and to the ſame he lets his <hi>preſence to be ſeen through a glaſſe darkly,</hi> as S. Paul ſpeaks; I come now to ſay, That it is without all compariſon a greater favour which God doth to them, to whom God lets <hi>his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence be ſeen,</hi> then that which he doth to them, to whom he doth make his <hi>preſence to be felt;</hi> inaſmuch as he that ſees it, it is neceſſary that he ſhould feel it; but it is not neceſſary that he that feels it, ſhould ſee it: I would ſay, inaſmuch as ſight cannot ſtand without feeling, but feeling may be without ſeeing. That this may be well underſtood, I ſay, that as I underſtand it, then a man <hi>feels the preſence of God,</hi> when loving, and believing, being confident, and hoping, and when praying, and working, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he doth really and indeed <hi>feel</hi> that he is moved and enabled by the holy Spirit to love, to believe, to have confidence, and to hope, and alſo to pray, to work, and to underſtand, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the holy Spirit is that which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire him to love, to believe, to have confidence,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99333:105"/> and to hope. And it is he himſelf that prayes, works, and underſtands in him: for ſo it is, that in all theſe exerciſes, feeling the favour of the holy Spirit, he feels the preſence of God. Furthermore I ſay, that then a man <hi>ſees the preſence of God,</hi> when by the gracious favour of God it is ſhewed unto him, in what manner God ſuſtains all the things which he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their proper being in which he created them; and in what manner God fayling them, or with-drawing himſelf from them never ſo little, they would fail in their beings. To make clear this Conſideration, I imagine that which is ordinarily ſeen in the houſe of a Prince, where all they that abide in his houſe, do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of him, and are ſuſtain'd by him in that degree and in that dignitie, in which he hath placed them; and the Prince dying all the whole houſe breaks up, and ceaſeth to be; in ſuch ſort as he that was Secretary, is now ſo no longer: The ſame I ſay of all the other Officers of the houſe, who all of them in the Princes death looſe that being, which the Princes life gave unto them.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on forwards, I conſider that which by experience is underſtood in a man, who is ſo far a man inaſmuch as his ſoul ſtayes in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that being altogether ſuſtained by the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof. I would ſay, that the members of the body exerciſe their own offices ſo long
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:99333:105"/> as the ſoul abides within the body; the ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, the body diſſolves and returns to earth; in ſuch manner, as they are now no more eyes, which were formerly eyes, the ſame I ſay of all the members of the body, all which, the ſoul being departed from the body, looſe that being which they had by the preſence of the ſoul in the body.</p>
               <p>In the Princes houſe becauſe I am able with my wit and judgement to conſider and ſee that which I have ſaid, it is ſufficient to ſee, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the preſence of the Prince, his providence, his bounty, liberality, and juſtice, inaſmuch as he maintains his houſe with good order, and with good government. And inaſmuch as I am able with my wit, and diſcourſe to underſtand by experience, that the ſoul being parted from the body, a man ceaſeth to be that which he was, every one of his members ceaſing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the office which it exerciſed: I am able alſo to underſtand by experience, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which the body hath, comes by the ſoul, and that the ſoul is ſhe that governs every one of the members of the body as is meet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to ſerve to that for which they were created. And ſo I underſtand that there are in the ſoul providence, and diſcretion, and all the other good qualities annexed thereunto. But in God, inaſmuch as I am not able either with my wit, or by experience to underſtand in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:99333:106"/> all things depend of him, in ſuch ſort, as he failing them, they fail; I cannot by my ſelf ſee that which is in the Princes houſe, nor underſtand that which I underſtand in a man; albeit by that which I hear ſpoken, and by that which I read, I may imagine it: But wanting the ſeeing, and vvanting the underſtanding by experience, I cannot certifie my ſelf in it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God himſelf let me ſee, and underſtand how this is, ſhewing me his preſence, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand conſiſteth in this, to ſee how all things depend on him, and are united to him; he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to them life, motion, and being. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I underſtand, that it would be great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the Princes favourite ſervant, when the Prince were unalterable, and immortall, to ſee that his being and his ſuſtentation in that degree comes to him from the Prince, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the life of the Prince. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand alſo, that it would be very great ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſee really, and indeed in what manner the being and ſuſtentation of his body depends upon his ſoul. And I underſtand that it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any compariſon much higher, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then any of theſe, that ſatisfaction, that glory, and that content which thoſe perſons feel in themſelves, who in any ſort whatſoever, ſee in what manner God ſuſtains and maintains all things, giving unto them a being, and giving unto them life, in ſuch manner as without him
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:99333:106"/> they would ceaſe to be, and to live. For in this viſion they know, and feel themſelves favoured of God, and in the ſame they quiet themſelves, and aſſure themſelves in their own minds; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that they are ſuſtained and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him, who hath all things in his own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And in the ſame viſion in a new manner they know in God omnipotency, wiſdome, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, mercy, truth, and fidelity; and knowing this, they grow in the love of God, in faith, and in the confidence of God, and in patience, with which they hope for eternall life. And ſo that comes to paſſe which I ſaid in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that a man ſeeing the preſence of God begins to taſte in part in this preſent life, that which he ſhall taſte intirely with Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

Yet the other remains, which is ſo much harder to leave, by how much humane wiſdome doth not know it; nay rather judgeth them vile, and of no worth that have it not: But the holy Spirit which knows it, judgeth them ambitious which have it; and will that they whom he governs, ſhould utterly leave it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it and free themſelves, in ſuch manner, that they have no intent to grow in the eyes of the world, nor are they ſtudious to keep what they have, although it require not of them, that they ſhould ſtudiouſly, and for their own phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies do things, by which they ſhould come to be abaſed, and diminiſhed from that ſtate of

               <p>ALL men are generally maligne, and perverſe, inſomuch as to walk amongſt them is the ſame as to walk amongſt Tygres, and Lions, and amongſt Vipers, and ſerpents: except one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inaſmuch as their furies, and their outrages are tied by ſome chains, amongſt which the chiefeſt, and moſt ſtrong are <hi>honour,</hi> inaſmuch as pertains to this preſent life, and <hi>conſcience</hi> for the life to come. I would ſay, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>honour</hi> of the world doth bridle ſome men that they are not ſo <hi>vicious,</hi> nor ſo licentious in their living, as they would be, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their naturall inclination: And ſome other men the fear of eternall puniſhment bridleth; for they think, if I do this I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, and he will puniſh me with eternall puniſhment: And this is the <hi>conſcience,</hi> in ſuch manner that a man may ſay, that all men who are not governed by the holy Spirit, are like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lions that ſtand chained, that they ſhould not do harm, but in ſuch manner as breaking the chains with their furie, they do evil accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their naturall inclination, inaſmuch as the men that ſtand bound with theſe chains, do not evil, nor are licentious; but the chains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken with their fury, and rage, they do
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:99333:108"/> evil according to their naturall inclination. Whereupon conſidering, that of theſe chains with which men ſtand bound, the ſtrongeſt is the honour of the world; inaſmuch as a man doth more eaſily caſt his conſcience behind, then his <hi>honour;</hi> I come to underſtand that the men who attend unto the <hi>honour of the world,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are tyed with the ſtronger chain, are amongſt the other men of the world, the leſſe <hi>vicious</hi> and leſſe licentious, partly by their own proper inclinations; for being ſubject to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of humane wiſdome they do much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem <hi>honour;</hi> partly for reſpect of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with whom they take counſell; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves applyed to <hi>honour,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it, do alwayes counſell rightly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which belongs to <hi>honour;</hi> which doth not ſo happen in <hi>conſcience,</hi> inaſmuch as a man is not of himſelf inclined unto it, either becauſe he doth not believe more then he ſees, or becauſe he doubts, or becauſe he puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the hazard; and inaſmuch as willing to be counſelled in thoſe things whereof he doubts, he takes counſell with other men, who neither are applyed to <hi>conſcience,</hi> nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and ſo cannot counſell rightly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which is due to conſcience. That this is true, he ſhall clearly know, whoſoever ſhall come to examine himſelf; finding it true that they do more eſteem <hi>honour</hi> then <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:99333:109"/> and that they are more reſolutely, and more virtuouſly counſelled in a buſineſſe, when they put it in a caſe of <hi>honour,</hi> then when they put it in a caſe of <hi>conſcience.</hi> And it may be, that the cauſe, wherefore (according as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) they live leſſe <hi>viciouſly</hi> amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, then amongſt thoſe, who are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, is becauſe they in moſt things attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>honour,</hi> and theſe in many things attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>conſcience.</hi> Out of this generality I except regenerated men, renewed by the holy ſpirit, who without being bound with chains, live mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, and temperately; In this they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the holy Spirit, which is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them that believe: In whom this government is ſo powerfull, that without being bound with any chain; (for they fear not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, nor are of ſcrupulous conſcience) they paſſe the men of the world in not being vicious, and licentious, having ſlain all their affections on the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That Prayer and Conſideration are two books or Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters very ſure ones to underſtand holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and how a man ought to ſerve himſelf of them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Hold it for a very certain and very true thing, that for the underſtanding of holy Scripture, the beſt, the moſt certain, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt interpreters of all, that a man can find, are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:99333:109"/> theſe two, <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Conſideration. Prayer</hi> as I underſtand, diſcovers the way, and opens, and manifeſteth it: And <hi>Conſideration</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, puts a man into it, and makes him walk therein.</p>
               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that theſe two interpreters or books ſhould be helped on Gods part, he inſpiring him who prayes, to pray. For I underſtand that he who prayes, not being inſpired to pray, prayes out of his own proper phantaſie, out of his own proper affection, and out of his own proper will; and not knowing to pray as he ought, is not heard in his prayer: and he who prayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſpired to pray, prayes for the glory of God, and prayes for the will of God, and knowing to pray as he ought, he is heard in his prayer, that being granted him which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſideration,</hi> as I underſtand, ought to be helped on mans part, who conſidereth of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things with his proper experience. I would ſay that he who conſiders, ſhould have proved in himſelf thoſe things, of which holy Scripture ſpeaks; in ſuch manner, that by what he finds, and knows in himſelf, he comes to underſtand that which is written in holy Scripture. They who conſider without this experience, go in the dark, and go groping, and albeit they ſometimes divine, and ſome other times they do hit right,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:99333:110"/> not having the proof thereof in themſelves, they neither know, whether they do hit right, nor reliſh that wherein they do hit right.</p>
               <p>And they who are in prayer helped from the holy ſpirit, and in conſideration are helped by their own proper experience, oft-times hitting right, or rather as it were alwayes, they do both know that they hit right, and they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that, wherein they do hit right. To be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood, I declare my ſelf with two au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, one of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> daring to put the example in my ſelf. I ſay that reading that of S. <hi>Paul, Even as the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Jeſus Chriſt is confirmed in you,</hi> and willing to underſtand it well, firſt I will work with the book of prayer, praying God that he will open unto me the way for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words; and in my prayer I ſtand ſteady, as much as I can keep my mind firm in it. Afterwards opening the book of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I begin to conſider within my ſelf, of what Chriſtian matters I have any experience; and I begin alſo to examine, what is that teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt, which he brought unto the world. And finding in me the government of the holy ſpirit, and feeling my ſelf juſtified in the juſtice of God executed in Chriſt (which two things are ſo joyned together, that a man can hardly underſtand, which of them he feels moſt, either the government of the holy ſpirit, or the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99333:110"/> by faith;) and underſtanding that the teſtimony, which Chriſt publiſhed unto the world, doth principally reſolve it ſelf into two parts, that is, into that; <hi>The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> or the kingdome of God (which is all one) <hi>draws near;</hi> and into that, which he ſpeaking of his own bloud ſaith, <hi>For you, and for many it ſhall be ſhed to remiſſion of ſinnes:</hi> Of which two parts, one hath intent unto the kingdome of God, which is begun to be felt, and taſted in this preſent life, and is continued, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in life eternall; the other unto the juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that is by Chriſt: I come to reſolve my ſelf, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood, that the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> might teſtifie by their proper experience, that Chriſt ſpake the truth in the teſtimony which he gave unto the world, as well touching the coming of the kingdome of God, as alſo of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by the juſtice of God executed in his moſt precious fleſh. And I underſtand, that ſo much a man may call, and judge himſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, inaſmuch as he hath this teſtimony of Chriſt our Lord confirmed in himſelf. In like manner willing to underſtand that of <hi>David, For I am a ſtranger with thee,</hi> &amp;c. and having opened the book of Prayer, I open that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and I go examining in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I am a Pilgrim, and ſtranger in this preſent life. And finding, that I am ſuch, inaſmuch as I am not known, nor am prized, nor eſteemed
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99333:111"/> in the world, and inaſmuch as I do not prize, nor eſteem the world: And finding likewiſe, that God in this ſelf ſame manner is a Pilgrim in the world; for he is not known, nor prized, nor eſteemed in the world; and becauſe he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prizeth, nor eſteemeth the world, holding it for that which it is, I underſtand, that <hi>David</hi> would ſay: <hi>Lord, becauſe the world doth that with me, which it doth with thee, and I do that with it which thou doſt, I am a ſtranger with thee.</hi> And I underſtand, that in this manner the Saints of the Law were ſtrangers with God; and in this manner are the Saints of the Goſpel, and amongſt them as the head the Son of God our Lord.</p>
               <p>In this manner I underſtand a man is to ſerve himſelf of theſe two divine books: and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the one helps the other marvellouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And I alſo underſtand, that he who can conſider with his proper experience, doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes erre, when he ſets himſelf to conſider without having firſt opened the book of Prayer. And I think that alwayes as it were, when he is moved to pray, the motion is the inſtinct of God.</p>
               <p>Out of all this I gather, that this being true, that the true underſtanding of the Scripture ought to be ſought by means of theſe two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters or books, which are Prayer, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: and that prayer needs to helped with the inſpiration of God, and Conſideration with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99333:111"/> the experience of that man that conſiders; it is alſo true, that to the pious Chriſtian, who ſets himſelf to holy Scripture, it appertains to live in a continued deſire, that God would give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him his holy ſpirit, and to attend to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of all that which is fleſh and humane wiſdome in him, to the intent, that vivification may ſucceed to mortification: for they onely, who have begun to be mortified, and to live, can conſider by their own proper experience; for they onely feel in themſelves the ſpirituall gifts of God, which they obtain, who believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99333:112"/> themſelves to be dead on Chriſts Croſſe, they have made, and do make with the world, and with themſelves: it is alſo needfull, that this food of <hi>curioſity</hi> ſhould be taken from them, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it unto them in any manner, nor by any way; taking it from them principally in thoſe things, in which piety, religion, and holineſſe, which are the moſt precious things, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And amongſt theſe I hold for moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous the ſtudy of <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> when it is with <hi>curioſity:</hi> for albeit it is ordinarily a good means to kill the mind of man; the mind is on the other ſide ſo alive, that it converts it into <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity,</hi> delighting to maintain it ſelf with that alone, when it cannot with other things.

               <p>HAving oft-times ſaid, that the mortification of all that which a man hath from <hi>Adam,</hi> is very neceſſary to a Chriſtian: it is not long ſince that I underſtood the cauſe why it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and the moſt certain, and moſt ſecure way to come to obtain it. And I have learned it from the Apoſtle Saint Paul, where he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid, that he <hi>did endeavour to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like unto the death of Chriſt,</hi> with intent to come to the participation of his reſurrection; labouring to comprehend the Chriſtian perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as he felt himſelf comprehended by it in Chriſt; he ſaith, that <hi>he did this altogether forgetting things that were behind,</hi> as well thoſe which might breed him ſatisfaction, as alſo thoſe which might cauſe him moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and occupying his mind, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that he was called of God through Chriſt, and that the vocation was from above, that is, that he was called, to the intent that believing he might obtain everlaſting life, or rather I underſtand, that it is the continuall thought and deſire of everlaſting life, by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99333:113"/> which the holy ſpirit mortifies them, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called of God do anſwer to their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo it is, that a man keeping in his memory this thought, comes to fly and abhorre all thoſe things that may hinder him this vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and he comes to ſeek and love all thoſe things which may conſerve, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it; and ſo coming to hate his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and appetites, knowing that they are thoſe which may hinder his vocation, he comes to mortifie them in ſuch manner, that all that which he had of Adam dying in him, and that which is of Chriſt living in him, he comes to be much like unto Chriſt, it befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unto him the ſame which befalls a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who being called by a great prince to a great feaſt, and fearing to be hindred, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in his journey by ſome delightfull things that may preſent themſelves unto him, he takes as expedient to free himſelf from all thoſe things, and to paſſe freely through them, to keep alwayes in his memory, that he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by that great prince, and that he is called unto that great feaſt, in compariſon whereof all thoſe feaſts that may offer themſelves unto him in the way, are not feaſts, but childrens playes. I would ſay, that this perſon carrying this thought alive in his memory doth mortifie in himſelf all thoſe appetites which might come unto him of ſeeing thoſe feaſts, which offer
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:99333:114"/> themſelves to him in the way, much better then if ſo be he ſhould make a reſolution not to ſee them. For it might be, that coming by chance to ſee them, he ſhould be hindered, and diſturbed by them, in ſuch manner that when he ſhould come to ſee the principall feaſt it would now be finiſhed. Even ſo the perſon that is called of God, keeping alive in his memory the thought of his vocation, doth mortifie and kill in himſelf all the affections and appetites, which being according to the old man might hinder him, and diſturb his vocation, much better, then if he did determine alwayes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with them: For it might be, that wandring from the thought and memory of his vocation, he might alſo wander from his determination. I ſhall ſay better, that doing after this manner, the holy Spirit is that which mortifies him; and if he ſhould do in other manner, it being hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome that ſhould work, he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to obtain his intent; it being Gods ordinance, that the ſpirit of God ſhould be the maſter and the guide of all them, that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led unto the grace of the Goſpel of his onely begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>EVery day I go certifying my ſelf, that the Chriſtian buſineſſe is not <hi>knowledge,</hi> but <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:</hi> I would ſay, that it is not got by knowledge, but by experience. Firſt of all I underſtood, that the proper exerciſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to attend unto <hi>mortification.</hi> Attending unto it he feels, that the profit of it conſiſts in this, that a man mortifying his affections and appetites, goes by little and little comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that divine Chriſtian perfection, in which he is compriſed by the incorporation, with which believing he is incorporated in Chriſt. Paſſing on further, I know that the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſecure way, by the which he who is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of God, comes to true <hi>mortification,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to hold firm in his memory a firm thought, that he is called of God, and that the <hi>calling</hi> is made to give him everlaſting life. Now I underſtand that this marvellous effect of <hi>mortification</hi> through the remembrance of the <hi>vocation,</hi> proceeds partly from the baſeneſſe of the fleſh, and partly from the efficacy of the things of God. I would ſay that the fleſh being vile, and miſerable, and being every way feeble, and infirm to be able to hold in it ſelf the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and ſenſes of divine things, it comes to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99333:115"/> paſſe, that by the efficacy of them it is affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and becomes vile in its own eyes; in ſuch manner, that it is eaſily overcome, and maſtered by the ſpirit, and ſo it remains mortified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all thoſe things which are corrupt in a man by the depravation of the fleſh. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the remembrance of the calling by God is very efficacious in men with the <hi>knowledge and ſenſe of heavenly things,</hi> and that all men are frail and infirm, I underſtand that which God ſaith, <hi>That a man who ſhall ſee him ſhall not be able to live.</hi> And therefore the perfect viſion of God is reſerved to the juſt in eternall life; when the fleſh being raiſed up ſhall be a ſubject able to endure the viſion of God. In this mean ſpace on the one ſide by the benefit of God, the <hi>fleſh is mortified</hi> in the juſt, not onely in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their <hi>vocation</hi> to life everlaſting, but alſo with every other particular vocation and ſenſe, which appertains to the things of God: And on the other ſide God goes moderating in them theſe knowledges, and theſe ſenſes, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould not come to nothing, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating them to the frailty of the fleſh, as we temper the hot liquor, which we would keep in a glaſſe veſſell, in ſuch manner, as the liquor is preſerved in the veſſell without breaking the glaſſe. And I underſtand, that corporall and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exerciſes, together with thoſe other things which are of mans induſtry, do ſerve unto thoſe
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99333:115"/> perſons which are called of God, for a certain entertaining of themſelves in that ſtate and meaſure of grace, unto which the knowledge and ſenſe of heavenly things hath brought them, untill ſuch time as by theſe exerciſes and labours there is given unto them a new and freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the knowledge and ſenſe of God and heaven, which may make them to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in <hi>mortification:</hi> in ſuch manner, that I have reaſon to ſay, that the Chriſtian buſineſſe is not <hi>knowledge,</hi> but <hi>experience.</hi> If it were knowledge, it would work the effect that other knowledges do, that is, to ſwell up, and make proud thoſe who have it. And becauſe it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, it doth the effect which other experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences do, that is, to humble and caſt on the ground all that which is humane wiſdome, and to exalt and lift up to heaven all that which is in the ſpirit.

                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:99333:116"/> as unto the true, which conſiſteth in <hi>accepting the grace of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> do apply themſelves likewiſe to <hi>mortification.</hi> But amongſt them who apply themſelves to this mortification, I have conſidered <hi>eight notable differences,</hi> by which a perſon may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he <hi>mortifies himſelf by his own industry,</hi> or whether he be <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt difference is, that they who <hi>mortifie themſelves by their own proper induſtry,</hi> are preſumptuous and ambitious, knowing their own proper virtue in their mortification; but they who are <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit,</hi> are humble, and modeſt, not knowing any proper virtue of their own in their mortifications: for the holy Spirit works in them that which a very great fever doth; for as by a fever a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as it were deprived of all carnall deſires, keeping alive onely the deſire of health; ſo by the preſence of the holy Spirit a man becomes as it were deprived of all that which is fleſh, keeping alive onely ſpirituall deſires.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difference is, that they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>mortifie themſelves,</hi> go alwayes ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new wayes and new inventions to obtain mortification; but they who are <hi>mortified by the Spirit,</hi> embrace thoſe occaſions of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are offered unto them, by what way ſoever they come, perſwading themſelves, that with them and in them, God will mortifie them.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:99333:116"/>
               <p>The third difference is, that they who <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves</hi> alwayes live ſad and diſcontent, becauſe they deprive themſelves of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and corporall contents, and are not che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with the ſpirituall; but they who are <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified</hi> by the Spirit, live as it were alwayes chearfull and contented, becauſe they abhorre, or begin to abhorre corporall pleaſures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to taſt ſpirituall pleaſures.</p>
               <p>The fourth difference is, that they who <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves,</hi> are much like unto a man, whoſe head were cut with a rough and ruſty ſaw, inaſmuch as all things are unſweet and ſowre unto him: but they who are <hi>mortified</hi> by the Spirit, are like unto a man whoſe head were cut with a ſharp ſword, and an arm skilfull in cutting; inaſmuch as the <hi>holy Spirit mortifies him,</hi> he himſelf oftentimes not feeling the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification till it be paſt. That this is true, thoſe perſons who are mortified by the holy Spirit know by experience.</p>
               <p>The fifth difference is, that they who <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves</hi> living alwaies in continuall trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in continuall labour, are like unto a man that learns with exceeding pains a moſt difficult and unpleaſant ſcience, who finding in the principles thereof much unſweetneſſe, and much moleſtation, comforts himſelf onely with an opinion, that he ſhall at laſt prove excellent in that ſcience: but they that are <hi>mortified,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:99333:117"/> troubling nor diſquieting themſelves in their mortifications, are like unto a man that goes delighting and recreating himſelf in the ſtudy of that ſcience which he hath already lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, wherein finding few things which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not, he finds few things that trouble him.</p>
               <p>The ſixth difference is, that in them who <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves by themſelves,</hi> there is never true mortification; nay rather, they are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to quick lime, inaſmuch as the quick lime ſmokes not whileſt there is no water caſt thereon, which is no ſooner caſt upon it, then it ſhews the fire that it hath within; ſo they whileſt they have no occaſion to erre, do not erre; and when occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion comes, they preſently ſhew the livelineſſe that they have within them, either erring, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtraightly ſolicited to erre: but they who are <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit,</hi> have true mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and are like unto dead lime, inaſmuch that like as the dead lime doth not ſmoke, how much water ſoever be caſt upon it: ſo neither do they erre, nor are much ſolicited to erre, although many occaſions offer themſelves unto them.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh difference is, that they who <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves,</hi> in the occaſion of erring do mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably looſe themſelves; for being deceived by humane wiſdome, they do alwayes go ſolicitouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſcrupulouſly, avoiding the occaſions which incite them to erre: but they who are <hi>mortified by the ſpirit,</hi> even in the occaſions of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:99333:117"/> erring that offer themſelves unto them, are refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as gold in the fire, for being helped by the holy Spirit in the proper occaſions they are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, not avoiding any of them; and therefore they are the ſame in the occaſions, as out of the occaſions.</p>
               <p>The eighth difference is, That they who <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themſelves</hi> by their proper induſtry, do principally attend unto the mortification of the fleſh, having no intent to mortifie the mind, not knowing that from thence ariſeth all the evil: but they who are <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit,</hi> attend principally unto the mortification of the mind, knowing that from thence comes all the evil; and knowing that the mind being mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the fleſh remains mortified.</p>
               <p>By the examination of theſe differences, may a perſon know whether he <hi>mortifies himſelf,</hi> or whether he be <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed of this, that there are three eſtates or ſorts of thoſe perſons who are <hi>mortified by the holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The one is, when the <hi>holy Spirit mortifies them</hi> without their knowledge or feeling of the virtue of the holy Spirit in them. And in this eſtate that belongs to them, which is ſaid in the fourth difference.</p>
               <p>The other is, when the <hi>holy Spirit mortifies them,</hi> and they feel and know in themſelves the virtue of the holy Spirit. And in this eſtate,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99333:118"/> there appertains unto them that which is ſaid in the firſt difference.</p>
               <p>The third ſort is, when through the abſence of the holy Spirit, or becauſe they do not feel and know his preſence, they go <hi>mortifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own induſtry.</hi> And in this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate they feel a good part of that which is ſaid in the firſt, third, fourth, and fifth difference: for it is very true, that to them who are <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the holy Spirit,</hi> their own induſtries in mortification are profitable unto them; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>That to them that love God, all things work for good to the glory of God, and of the Son of God Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99333:118"/> that the will of God ſhould be executed, accepting it as a benefit of God, that <hi>thoſe evils ſhould not come in his time:</hi> And conſidering that God prolonged the time of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> life, and that he did execute his ſentence upon <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> I come to certifie my ſelf, that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons being governed by the ſpirit of God, and chiefly in their prayers, inaſmuch as S. Paul ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of God prayes by them, and in them,</hi> they do never as it were pray to God, but for that which it is Gods will to grant them, of which the holy Spirit which inſpires them to pray, is certain. According to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane reaſon, it had been more juſt and more convenient, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould have reſented himſelf, and lamented, and been moved to pray God for the revocation of the ſentence given againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then for the revocation of that ſentence which was given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>own proper life:</hi> but <hi>Hezekias</hi> a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous king, moved by the holy Spirit <hi>prayed for his own life;</hi> and for that which touched <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he conformed himſelf with Gods will: whereby I underſtand, that it behoves pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to keep good account with their motions; I would ſay, they ought to be wel advertiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>moved to pray</hi> to God for any thing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>motion be of humane ſpirit,</hi> or <hi>of the holy ſpirit.</hi> And I underſtand likewiſe, that the proper counterſigne whereby they may be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99333:119"/> able to judge between theſe motions, is the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward certainty, or uncertainty with which they ſhall find themſelves in prayer.</hi> Finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uncertain that they ſhould obtain of God that which they demand, they ſhall judge that the motion is of <hi>humane ſpirit;</hi> and finding themſelves certain to obtain it, they ſhall judge that the motion is of the <hi>holy Spirit:</hi> forasmuch as the <hi>motion of the holy Spirit</hi> draws alwayes with it the <hi>certification;</hi> a man judging in this manner, if the Spirit of God which hath moved me to pray, did not know that it is the will of God to grant me that which I demand, it would not have moved me. This certification I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hold was in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> at that time when he demanded his <hi>life to be prolonged.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not feel in himſelf this certification, I do certainly hold, that the ſelf-ſame <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> did not demand that the ſentence againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> ſhould be revoked. With this <hi>aſſurance</hi> I ſee that Chriſt <hi>prayed,</hi> raiſing up <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> for the conſervation of his diſciples.

               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>ſeverity</hi> and <hi>rigour</hi> that I ſee and know for the moſt part in thoſe perſons which the common people hold for devout and ſpirituall, they being in very truth <hi>ſuperstitious</hi> and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, inaſmuch as appertains to the chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or deſiring to chaſtice the vices and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of men; I underſtand proceeds from <hi>two cauſes.</hi> The one is the proper nature of a man, who is inclined to prize and eſteem his own things, and to condemn and deſpiſe others. And the other is the proper nature of <hi>ſuperstitions</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> to which is annexed <hi>ſeverity,</hi> and <hi>rigourouſneſſe.</hi> And ſo it is, that theſe <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious</hi> and <hi>ceremonious</hi> perſons, deſiring that their ſuperſtitious and ceremonious living ſhould be eſteemed and prized, are forced to be <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>rigourous</hi> with works and words againſt them, who being not as they are, have outward defects and vices, that ſo their manner of life which they hold for virtuous, may be the more prized and eſteemed. And it is likewiſe
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99333:120"/> true, that ſuperſtitions and ceremonies having their originall and beginning from ſome kind of law, which men have imagined, and ſeverity and rigour being annexed to the nature of a law, (for by theſe it is maintained,) it comes to paſſe, that as well thoſe who attend to the <hi>obſervation of the law,</hi> or of the <hi>ceremonies</hi> and <hi>ſuperstitions</hi> that ariſe from it, as alſo they who attend to cauſe others to obſerve them, are <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi> againſt them that do not obſerve them.

                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:99333:120"/> And alſo it comes from hence, that God ſhews more <hi>pity and mercy,</hi> then <hi>ſeverity and rigour.</hi> In ſuch manner, that the affection of <hi>ſeverity</hi> and <hi>rigour</hi> in a man is a ſigne of ſelf-love, and of a mind ſubject to the law, to <hi>ſuperſtitions</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> as were the minds of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews:</hi> And a pitifull, and mercifull affection is a ſigne of <hi>mortification,</hi> and of a mind freed from the Law by the Goſpel; ſuch are thoſe of true Chriſtians, members of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                        </gap>; for the law is not made for a righteous man, 1 Tim. 1.9. But when he enlargeth he goes too farre. For firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Abraham and Sarah, I ever took that for a weakneſſe in the great Patriarch, and that the beſt of Gods ſervants ſhould have weakneſſes, is no way repugnant to the way of Gods ſpirit in them, or to the Scriptures, or to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, being ſtill men, though godly men. Nay they are purpoſely recorded in holy Weir. Wherefore as Davids adultery cannot be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo need not Abrahams equivocation, nor Pauls neither, when he profeſſed himſelf a Phariſee, which ſtrictly he was not, though in the point of Reſurrection he agreed with them, and they with him. The reviling alſo of Ananias ſeems by his own recalling, an overſight; yet I remember the Fathers forbid us to judge of the doubtfull actions of Saints in Scriptures, which is a modeſt admonition. But it is one thing not to judge, another to defend them. Secondly, when he uſeth the word juriſdiction, allowing no juriſdiction over the godly, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand, and it is ill doctrine in a Common-wealth. The godly are puniſhable as others, when they do amiſſe, and they are to be judged according to the outward fact, unleſſe it be evident to others as well as to themſelves that God moved them; for otherwiſe any malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour may pretend motions, which is inſufferable in a Common-wealth. Neither do I doubt but if Abraham had lived in our kingdome under government, and had killed his ſonne Iſaac, but he might juſtly have been put to death for it by the Magiſtrate, unleſſe he could have made it appear, that it was done by Gods immediate precept. He had done juſtly, and yet had been puniſhed juſtly, that is, <hi>In humano foro, &amp;c. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum praeſumptionem legalem;</hi> according to the common and legall proceedings among men. So may a warre be juſt on both ſides, and was juſt in the Canaanites and Iſraelites both. How the godly are exempt from laws is a known point among Divines, but when he ſayes they are equally exempt with God, that is dangerous and too farre. The beſt ſalve for the whole Chapter is to diſtinguiſh judgement. There is a judgement of authority (upon a fact) and there is a judgement of the learned; for as a Magiſtrate judgeth in his tribunall, ſo a Scholar judgeth in his ſtudy, and cenſureth this or that; whence come ſo many books of ſeverall mens opinions: perhaps he meant all of this latter, not of the former. Worldly learned men cannot judge ſpirituall mens actions, but the magiſtrate may, and ſurely this the Author meant by the word <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> for ſo he uſeth the ſame word in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration 68. <hi>ad finem.</hi>
                     </note> juriſdiction in the judgement of their works, who are the Sonnes of God then in the judgement of the proper works of God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the ſelf ſame manner, and for the ſelf ſame cauſe, for which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood Rom. 8.14. that they who
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:99333:122"/> are governed by the Spirit of God, are the ſonnes of God, I underſtand that they who are the ſonnes of God, are governed by the Spirit of God. And I underſtand, that as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome is uncapable of the knowledge of God, ſo likewiſe it is uncapable of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, who are the ſonnes of God. And even as humane wiſdome diſcerneth not the admirable counſell that is in the works of God, ſo neither doth it diſcerne the divine counſell that is in the works of them, who are the ſonnes of God: both thoſe, and theſe being done by the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>Further I underſtand that humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when it ſets it ſelf to judge the works of them that are the ſonnes of God, condemning and taxing them, it doth ſo out of the ſelf ſame raſhneſſe, with which it ſets it ſelf to judge the works of God, condemning them, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating them. I would ſay, that that raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men is not leſſe, which follow the judgement of humane wiſdome, when they ſet themſelves to judge evil of Moſes for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews whom he ſlew when they worſhiped the Calf, Exod. 32.37. &amp;c. and when they ſet themſelves to judge evil of Abraham, becauſe
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99333:122"/> he commanded his wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> that ſhe ſhould lie, ſaying, that ſhe was his ſiſter, and not his wife: And becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> curſed <hi>Ananias,</hi> ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at judgement in his preſence. And becauſe he excuſed his curſing, ſaying, he did not know him. And when in like manner they ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to judge certain things like unto theſe, which the ſonnes of God do being governed by the ſpirit of God, which according to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of humane wiſdome are abſurd, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable, and according to the judgement of God, are holy, and good: I ſay, that this is no leſſe raſhneſſe then that, with which they ſet themſelves to judge evil of God, becauſe he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours many lewd men with temporall good, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving many good men thereof, and becauſe he doth other things which humane wiſdome calumniates, and condemns, and for which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws do rigorouſly chaſtiſe thoſe men that do them: inaſmuch as humane wiſdome hath no more juriſdiction in the judgement of the works of pious men, then in the judgement of the works of God, they being done by God himſelf, and the other by thoſe who being the Sonnes of God are governed by the ſpirit of God, and therefore are free, and exempt from all humane law, as God himſelf is free and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt. I would ſay, that men ſhould not have had more reaſon to have puniſh'd <hi>Abraham,</hi> if he had killed his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> then to condemne God,

                  <note place="margin">The Authour doth ſtill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover too ſlight a regard of the Scripture, as if it were but childrens meat, whereas there is not onely milk there, but ſtrong meat alſo, Heb. 5.14. things hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, 2. Pet. 3.16. Things needing great conſideration, Matth. 24.15. Beſides, he oppoſeth the teaching of the ſpirit to the teaching of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which the holy ſpirit wrote. Although the holy ſpirit apply the Scripture, yet what the Scripture teacheth, the ſpirit teacheth; the holy ſpirit indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doubly teaching, both in penning and in applying. I wonder how this opinion could befall ſo good a man as it ſeems <hi>Valdeſſo</hi> was, ſince the Saints of God in all ages have ever held in ſo precious eſteem the word of God, as their joy and crown, and their treaſure on earth. Yet his own practiſe ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his opinion, for the moſt of his <hi>Conſiderations</hi> being grounded upon ſome text of Scripture, ſhews that he was continually converſant in it, and not uſed it for a time onely, and then caſt it away, as he ſaves ſtrangely. There is no more to be ſaid of this chapter, eſpecially of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>th thing in it, but that this his opinion of the Scripture is unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. As for the text of S. Peter, 2. Pet. 1.19. which he makes the ground of this conſideration, building it all upon the word, <hi>untill the day-ſtarre ariſe;</hi> it is nothing. How many places do the fathers bring about <hi>Untill</hi> againſt the Hereticks who diſputed againſt the virginity of the bleſſed Virgin, out of the text, Matth. 1.25. Where it is ſaid, Joſeph knew her nor <hi>Untill</hi> ſhe had brought forth her firſt born ſon, as if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he had known her: and indeed in common ſenſe, if I bid a man ſtay in a place untill I come, I do not then bid him go away, but rather ſtay longer, that I may ſpeak w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him, or do ſomthing elſe when I come. So S. Peter bidding the diſperſed Hebrews attend to the word, till the day dawn, doth not bid them then caſt away the word, or leave it off; but however he would have them attend to it till that time, and then afterward they wil of themſelves attend it without his exhortation. Nay it is obſervable that in that very place he preferres the word before the fight of the tranſfiguration of Chriſt. So that the word hath the precedence even of Revelations and Viſions.</note>SAint <hi>Peter</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, chap. 1.9. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, that a man that attends unto piety, having no other light to guide him in it, then that of the holy Scripture, is like unto a man that is ſet in a dark place having no other light in it, then the light of a candle; and he underſtands that the man that attends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to piety having obtained the ſpirit of God which guides him, and ſets him in the way, is like unto a man that ſtands
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99333:123"/> in a place, wherein the ſun-beams enter, which make it clear, and reſplendent: Whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeven things. The firſt, that as the man ſet in a dark place, ſtands better with a candle then without it: ſo the man that attends unto piety, which to him is a dark place, inaſmuch as humane reaſon, and wiſdome do rather do him harm, then good in it, ſtands better with the holy Scripture then without it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which I conſider is, that as a man in a dark place ſees not the things that are therein ſo clearly, and manifeſtly with a candle, as he might ſee them with the ſun; ſo a man that attends unto piety doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, nor know the things of God, nor God himſelf ſo clearly and manifeſtly, with holy Scripture, as he might ſee and know them, with the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>The third thing which I conſider is, That as a man ſet in a dark place with the light of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:99333:124"/> candle onely, ſtands in danger to remain in the dark, if by any miſchance the candle ſhould be put out; ſo the man, who attending unto piety hath no other light then that of holy Scripture, ſtands in danger to remain without light, there coming any occaſion that may deprive him of the holy Scripture, or of the true underſtanding thereof.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing which I conſider is, that as it ſometimes befals a man ſet in a dark place, where the light of the candle is, that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous it ſhould give more light, he ſnuffes it himſelf, or ſeeks ſome other to ſnuffe it; and in the ſnuffing, it ſo comes to paſſe, that it is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and a man remains without light; ſo unto a man, that attends unto piety onely, with that which he knows and underſtands by holy Scripture, it ſometimes comes to paſſe, that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to underſtand more, or better in it, or by it, either he himſelf interprets it, or ſeeks ſome to interpret it to him, and in interpreting, it comes paſſe, that of holy Scripture making it humane Scripture, a man remains in the dark, albeit he doth not ſo perſwade himſelf.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing which I conſider is, that as upon the Sun-beams entrance into an obſcure, place, where a man ſerves himſelf of the light of a candle, it comes to paſſe, that a man ſees more clearly then before, all the things that are in that place, the candle remaining as it were
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99333:124"/> without light, and without ſplendour, in ſuch manner, that now a man being deſirous to ſee the things that are in that place, that which he leaſt looks upon is the candle: So the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit entring into the mind of a man, that attends unto piety, ſerving himſelf of the Scripture to that intent, it comes to paſſe, that a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and knows the things of God, and God himſelf more clearly then he did before; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture remaining, (inaſmuch as to him ward) as it were without light, and without ſplendour: in ſuch manner, as now being deſirous to underſtand the things of piety, and deſirous to know God, that which he leaſt looks upon is the holy Scripture, attending to conſider with the holy Spirit, that abides in his mind, and not with that which is written in the Scripture. And therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi> well commends the ſtudy of holy Scripture; but whileſt a man ſtands in the dark place of humane wiſdome, and reaſon, and he wills that this ſtudy ſhould continue ſo long, untill the light of the holy ſpirit ſhine into the mind of a man: underſtanding that this light being come, a man hath no more need to ſeek that of the holy Scripture, which departs of it ſelf, as the light of the candle departs, when the Sun-beams enter; and even as <hi>Moſes</hi> departed at the preſence of Chriſt, and the Law at the preſence of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>The ſixth thing which I conſider is, that as a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99333:125"/> man which enjoyes the light of the Sun, when he did certainly know that it would not fail him, albeit he would not caſt away the candle for the benefit received, but would rather leave it to the intent it might ſerve another to that purpoſe which it had ſerved him, and yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would not ſerve himſelf thereof in that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he did before ſerve himſelf: ſo the man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the light of the holy ſpirit, knowing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that it cannot fail him, albeit he do not caſt away holy Scripture, but rather leaves it, that it may ſerve to another for that which it hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for unto him; nevertheleſſe he doth not ſerve himſelf of it, in that whereof he did formerly ſerve himſelf, as I have before at other times conſidered.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh thing that I conſider is, that as it is not of the eſſence of the Sun, when it enters into a place where a candle ſtands, to ſhew and diſcover all that which the candle contains in it; ſo likewiſe it is not of the eſſence of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when it enters into the mind of him, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied unto piety ſerves himſelf of holy Scripture, to ſhew, and diſcover all the ſecrets that ſtand ſhut up therein, albeit it do ſhew, and diſcover that part of them, which God will ſhall be diſcovered unto a man to whom the holy Spirit is given.</p>
               <p>The gifts of the holy Spirit are different, &amp; the holy Scripture being written by divers perſons, who had different gifts of the holy Spirit, and ſo
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:99333:125"/> writ diverſly, by conſequence, it is underſtood of thoſe perſons, who have the holy Spirit, of one in one part, and of another in another part, according as the gifts are different, which are communicated from God with the holy Spirit by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

And let him take upon himſelf his Croſſe, which is his martyrdome, the ſhame, and the ignominy that he ſhall ſuffer in the eyes of the men of this world in being wanting unto himſelf, and to his own, and to his honour.

In the mean ſpace they being gone out of the kingdome of the world, having felt the tyranny of the foure Tyrants, do feel the ſweetneſſe, and pleaſantneſſe of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt, feeling in themſelves the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

Which hope and perſwaſion cauſeth in them this effect, that albeit they feel death ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the body, yet they feel it not as much as belongs to the ſoul, through the certain hope of reſurrection. In this I underſtand conſiſts the kingdome of Chriſt. And becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the juſt being accompliſhed, wo ſhall not need to combate with the Divel, there ſhall be no need to mortifie the fleſh, nor to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the world, nor ſhall there be death to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come: I underſtand, that Saint Paul ſaith, that when Chriſt ſhall reſigne this kingdome to the eternall Father; and that God ſhall be all in all, ruling and governing every thing by himſelf: in ſuch manner, as the kingdome of Chriſt according to Saint Paul ſhall endure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the univerſall reſurrection, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in men ſhall then begin, and ſhall be continuall, men perpetually acknowledging

               <p>BEing deſirous to underſtand, which ſpirit is more impetuous in a man, the Holy, or the Malignant; I reſolve my ſelf, that the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit is much more impetuous in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99333:128"/> then the good ſpirit in the pious; being moved to this reſolution for two Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which one is founded in the proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſpirits: for the malignant is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture impetuous, and the holy is by nature mild and quiet, inſomuch, that if at any time there ſeem to be violence, or alteration, that is none of its own, but of the livelineſſe of mans fleſh, in which, and by which the holy Spirit works. And the other is founded in the proper nature of men: for they being more inclined unto the motions of the malignant ſpirit, then to that of the holy ſpirit, it comes to paſſe, that unto that of the malignant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they are incited with their proper affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and inclination; and to thoſe others of the holy Spirit they are benummed from the ſelf ſame thing. In ſuch manner as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſpirit being impetuous of its own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, and the malignant ſpirit being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in the impious with the proper nature of the impious; and the holy Spirit being made more ſlow in the pious, through the proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the pious, inaſmuch as he is a man; it comes to paſſe, that the malignant ſpirit is more impetuous in the impious, then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the holy Spirit in the pious. And in the impious I underſtand that ordinarily the Holy ſpirit is nothing at all impetuous; and in the pious I underſtand the malignant ſpirit is more or leſſe impetuous, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

Underſtanding that all this is true, I underſtand likewiſe, that the pious, who would that the motions of the malignant ſpirit ſhould not have force nor be efficacious in him, and that the motions of the holy ſpirit ſhould have force and efficacy in him, ought to attend unto the mortification of his affections and appetites, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to mortifie in himſelf that which he hath of Adam, and to make alive that which he hath of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>ALL that in this life is done, known, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, is either by naturall inſtinct, or it is by experience, or by knowledge, or by divine inſpiration and revelation. In the beaſt there is naturall inſtinct and experience, as every one may by himſelf conſider. In men there is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally naturall inſtinct and experience, as in beaſts, although with greater excellency; and there is alſo knowledge, which as I underſtand, conſiſts in that which one man learns from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, man having no greater aſſurance thereof, then the relation that is made unto him; and this as much in divine things as in humane, In men regenerated by the holy Spirit there is naturall inſtinct, and experience, and knowledge, and moreover divine inſpiration and revelation. I ſay, that regenerated men know and underſtand ſome things by naturall inſtinct, others by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and others by ſcience, and others by divine inſpiration. The naturall inſtinct ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more chaſt and more pure in them, then in other men. And having experience not onely of naturall and humane things as other men have, but alſo of ſpirituall and divine things; and having not onely ſcience learned from other men, but alſo inſpired and revealed from
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99333:130"/> God. All men being without the holy Spirit, are without experience of ſpirituall and divine things; having onely that ſcience of them, which is gotten by the bare reading of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; whence it comes to paſſe, that as in the humane and naturall things of which they have no experience, having onely the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they remain with opinion, without any aſſurance; even ſo in divine matters, being without experience, they remain with opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without any aſſurance. Inaſmuch as where there is no experience, there can be no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And experience in the things of God is reſerved to them, who have the Spirit of God, who having experience of ſpirituall matters, know that they know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand naturall and humane things, I would ſay, that the difference between that which regenerated men know and underſtand in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, and that which other men, how wiſe ſoever they be, know and underſtand in the ſame things; is as much as is between that which thoſe Phyſicians which onely have the Theory, know and underſtand in Phyſick, and that which thoſe Phyſicians, who together with the Theory have the Practiſe. Whence I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that unregenerated men having no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in divine matters, cannot have either confidence or diffidence that ſhould be ſolid and firm; but onely through opinion, in ſuch
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99333:130"/> manner as they have in humane affairs. And therefore that is true which I have written in another Conſideration, that God oft-times gives unto pious perſons ſome things which they have no confidence to obtain, denying them ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which they have confidence to obtain; underſtanding that this comes to paſſe, when his confidence and his diffidence conſiſts in ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and opinion, and not in experience and certification. Furthermore, I come to gather that regenerated men having experience of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, have aſſurance of them, and that having aſſurance, they have alſo confidence and diffidence ſolid and firm. And therefore that is true which I have written in another Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that through that certainty or incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which pious perſons find themſelves in prayer, they may underſtand when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to pray by the holy Spirit, and when they are moved to pray from humane ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently when they are to be confident, and when they are to be diffident.</p>

                  <hi>HUmane wiſdome</hi> judgeth, that the <hi>deſire to know is a great perfection in man;</hi> and the holy ſpirit judgeth that it is a great imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a man. Humane wiſdome confirms her opinion, ſaying, That it hath been ſeen by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that in the world thoſe men have lived moſt virtuouſly, who having the greateſt deſire to know, have moſt given themſelves to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to know, and have known moſt: And here is alledged a troop of Philoſophers. And the holy Spirit on the contrary affirms his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, ſaying, That <hi>through the deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſinne came into the world, and through ſin,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99333:131"/> death,</hi> and with it all the miſeries and all the troubles whereunto we ſtand ſubject in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life. That this is true, is proved by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the devil, who ſaid unto Eve, <hi>You ſhall be like Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi> Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on further, the holy Spirit ſaith, that the <hi>deſire of knowledge deſtroyed the Hebrews;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as deſiring to underſtand the propheſies that ſpake of the Meſſias, and procuring to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them by the way of wit, and humane diſcourſe, they imagined to themſelves, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured a Meſſias ſo contrary to him whom God ſent them, as when they had him, they knew him not, and not knowing him they did not receive him, and from their not receiving him, redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely that they did not enjoy him, but it cauſed their ruine and perdition. Paſſing on further the holy Spirit ſaith, that <hi>the Gentiles deſiring to know the originall, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of naturall things, did procure to know them with their own wits &amp; diſcourſes;</hi> whence comes to paſſe that which S. Paul ſaid, <hi>They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vain in their imaginations, and they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the creature, and ran headlong into other abſurd and bruitiſh inconveniencies.</hi> In the ſame manner the holy Spirit ſaith, that many men deſiring to know the things which appertain to Chriſtian religion, and procuring it with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light, have made ſuch ſtrange conceits of God, and of Chriſt, and of the Chriſtian ſtate,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:99333:132"/> and of the Chriſtian living; that a man may ſay with truth, that of Chriſt they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the name; participating on one ſide of the inconvenience of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> inaſmuch as they read holy Scripture, and deſiring to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, procuring this not with that ſpirituall light with which it was written, but with natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light, they do not underſtand it: and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating on the other ſide of the inconvenience of the Gentiles, inaſmuch as deſiring to know that which the Gentiles knew, they read that which the Gentiles writ, and they think as the Gentiles thought, and frame Gentiles minds.</p>
               <p>The holy ſpirit having proved his ſentence againſt that deſire of knowing which men have, ſaith further, That that virtue which is got by deſiring to know, &amp; knowing that which may be known with naturall light, is rather a vice then a virtue; inaſmuch as it makes men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, inſolent, and conſequently impious, and incredulous. That this is true, appears by this, that the men that follow their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light, by how much they are more virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to the world, by ſo much they have leſſe confidence in God, and do ſo much leſſe believe in Chriſt, and therefore are ſo much more impious, and more incredulous; in ſuch manner, that I may well ſay that the deſire to know is a great imperfection in a man.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I learn two things. The one,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:99333:132"/> that humane wiſdome hath no juriſdiction in judging of the perfection and imperfection of a man. The other, that it appertains to every man who being called of God to the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, makes anſwer thereunto, to mortifie and kill in himſelf the deſire to know, of what ſort ſoever it be, that he may not fall into the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of falſe Chriſtians, and of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and of the Hebrewes, nor into that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our firſt parents fell; and that they may come to the perfection whereunto S.

Which wiſdome we ought to deſire and procure with prayer to God, we who having accepted the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are true Chriſtians incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

And in very truth great is the blindneſſe, and ignorance of men in every thing, that ſee onely with the eyes of humane wiſdome; and very exceſſive great in this, that not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in humane matters one teſtimony that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies onely of hear-ſay, except he ſpeak of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge, or proper experience; it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades it ſelf by it ſelf, and by others, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters it ſufficeth to teſtifie on hear-ſay, having neither certain knowledge, nor proper experience; neither pretending the one nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the other; and that which is worſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending them, who pretend the certain knowledge, and procure the experience, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting themſelves to teſtifie on hear-ſay by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relation of others.

               <p>From all this I come to gather, that a man ought to judge himſelf incredulous, and defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in the faith, as long as he hath not ſo <hi>much faith as ſufficeth therewith to remove mountains</hi> from one place to another; and that judging himſelf ſuch, he ought to demand of God, that he ſhould give him faith, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting himſelf to teſtifie in divine things by hear-ſay, and by relation, but by certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and proper experience.</p>

                  <hi>Faith</hi> as I underſtand, <hi>conſiſts in this, that a man ſhould believe and hold for a certain all that which is contained in holy Scripture, having confidence in the divine promiſes, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99333:135"/> in it, as if to him properly, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they had been made.</hi> Of the two parts of faith, which are <hi>to believe,</hi> and <hi>to have confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> I underſtand, that of one of them a mans mind is in ſome manner capable: I ſay, that a man is able to bring himſelf to believe, or at leaſt to perſwade himſelf, that he doth believe: And of the other I underſtand he is incapable; I ſay he is not able of himſelf, to reduce him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have confidence, nor to perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he hath confidence: in ſuch ſort, as he who believes, and hath not confidence, ſhews that his belief is induſtry, and humane wit, and not divine inſpiration; and he who believing hath confidence, ſhews that his belief is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and revelation.

               <p>
                  <hi>Hope,</hi> as I underſtand, <hi>conſiſts in patience, and in the ſufferance, with which a man that believes and hath confidence, expects the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the promiſes of God,</hi> without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf into the Divels ſervice with impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or into that of the world with vanity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of his own fleſh with vice. Like as a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain, who having promiſe from the Emperour that at his coming into Italy he will uſe his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, albeit the Emperour ſlow his journey, and he be ſolicited by many Princes, that would

This <hi>hope</hi> preſuppoſeth <hi>faith;</hi> I ſay that to expect, it is neceſſary, that there ſhould be faith in him who hopes, with which he ſhould give credit to that which is told him, and have confidence in that which is promiſed him: for otherwiſe he ſhould not be able to maintain himſelf in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting. And that <hi>hope</hi> doth properly conſiſt in this, I underſtand by ſome ſpeeches, which we read in the Goſpel, ſuch as is that of the <hi>ten vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> who did expect the <hi>bridegroome;</hi> and that of men, that expect <hi>their lord when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charity,</hi> I underſtand, <hi>conſiſts in the love, and in the affection, which a man that believes, hath confidence, and hopes, carries to God, and to Chriſt, and likewiſe to the things of God, &amp; of Chriſt,</hi> ſtanding properly affectionated, &amp; enamoured of believing, of having confidence, and of hoping; in ſuch manner, that becauſe he who hath <hi>theſe three gifts</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſtands united with God, believing, hoping, and loving, with great reaſon are theſe three gifts the moſt high, and moſt excellent amongſt all the other.</p>

And furthermore I underſtand, that it is neceſſary, that I ſhould reduce my ſelf to be with God ſuch an one, as a good and obedient Son is with his Father.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I conſider that ſaying <hi>Our,</hi> I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe, that I hold for brethren all thoſe, who through regeneration, hold God for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that I ought to govern my ſelf with them, as with brethren.</p>

               <p>Thirdly I conſider, that becauſe God is where he is known, holy Scripture uſeth to ſay, that God <hi>is in Heaven,</hi> for there God is known. God is in all his creatures; but it is not ſaid that he is, but onely in them who know him, and where he lets himſelf to be known.</p>
               <p>Fourthly I conſider, that the proper deſire of a pious Chriſtian is, that Gods <hi>Name ſhould be ſanctified;</hi> I would ſay, that God ſhould be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, and judged of every one for holy, and for juſt, in all his works, as he is in truth.</p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome not finding holineſſe, not juſtice in many of thoſe things which befall men in this life, flying from the inconvenience of attributing injuſtice to God, falls into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other inconvenience, depriving God of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular providence in all things. And the holy ſpirit knowing in all things holineſſe, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice on Gods part, doth not doubt to attribute them all to God; deſiring that men captivating the judgement of their own humane wiſdome, ſhould <hi>ſanctifie the Name of God,</hi> confeſſing, and holding that God doth all things, and that in all things is holineſſe, and juſtice. There are ſome men, who <hi>ſanctifie God</hi> in the things which they judge good, drawing themſelves back in thoſe things which they judge to be evil. And there are other men, who <hi>ſanctifie God</hi> generally in all things, but with the mouth, and not with the heart. And the deſire of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99333:137"/> the pious Chriſtian is, that God ſhould be <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified</hi> in all things, and that the ſanctification ſhould come from the heart; for in this manner God will be <hi>ſanctified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly I conſider, that the proper and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall ſighing of a pious Chriſtian conſiſts in the deſire that the <hi>kingdome of God ſhould ſuddenly come,</hi> when the reſurrection of the juſt being made, Chriſt ſhall reſigne the <hi>kingdome</hi> to his eternall Father. For that ſhall be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>kingdome of God,</hi> inaſmuch as the juſt ſhall be governed immediately by God, ſeeing God himſelf face to face. God reignes in this preſent life in the juſt, but by Chriſt, as he gives light but by the Sunne: and God ſhall reigne in life eternall by himſelf, as by himſelf he ſhall give light.</p>
               <p>Sixthly I conſider, that the pious Chriſtians flying from the will of God which is with wrath, and that which is mediate by thoſe things which we call ſecond cauſes, do demand that <hi>that will of God ſhould be done here on earth, which is done in heaven,</hi> underſtanding that which is with mercy, and with love, and that which is immediate by God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Seventhly I conſider, that the pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans feeling, that through the curſe for the firſt mans ſinne it reſults, that they eat their bread with ſorrow and care, they demand of God, that freeing them from the ſolicitouſneſſe and the

               <p>Eighthly I conſider, that the pious Chriſtians, not becauſe they make any doubt of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pardon which they have had by the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt, for of this they are moſt aſſured; but becauſe they rejoyce to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member themſelves that they are debtours; which remembrance breeds in them humility in the ſight of God; they ask alwayes of God, <hi>that he would pardon them thoſe things, for which he might in justice puniſh them.</hi> And I underſtand, that they alledge <hi>the pardon which they have given to them who were their deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,</hi> rather to oblige themſelves to pardon, then to oblige God that he ſhould for ſuch cauſe pardon them. This I underſtand thus, by that which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf addes in the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>If you pardon, you ſhall be pardoned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ninthly I conſider, that the pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans knowing their own weakneſſe, fear <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> inaſmuch as it may ſever them from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian decorum; and knowing herewith the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity which they have to be mortified with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99333:138"/> they demand of God, not that he ſhould not tempt them, but <hi>that the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be of that quality, that they ſhould not make them to looſe the Chriſtian decorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tenthly I conſider, that pious Chriſtians having underſtood that many are the <hi>evils</hi> that combat the juſt, they are afraid to be oppreſſed by them, and knowing the frailty of their own forces to be able to make reſiſtance, they have recourſe to God, demanding of him <hi>that he ſhould free them from all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe deſires, and in theſe demands I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that pious perſons ſtand and perſevere, not onely through the outward doctrine of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, which they find written in his hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo through the inward do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Spirit, who puts theſe deſires into their minds, and moves them to demand theſe things.

               </argument>
               <p>IN the creation of man, I reade that he was created after the image and ſimilitude of God.
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99333:139"/> And a little after I reade, that pretending to get the image of God, he became diſobedient to God, and was driven out of earthly Paradiſe. Whereupon underſtanding that the <hi>image</hi> and ſimilitude <hi>of God,</hi> with which man was created, was different from that which man in his depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation pretended unto, I am come to conſider, that the <hi>image of God</hi> with which a man was created, is that which appertained to him as a man, that which might ſtand and be received in him; and that the <hi>image of God</hi> which a man pretended unto, is that which did not appertain unto him as a man, that which is properly of God not being communicable to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And albeit from the words which contain the creation of man, there is onely gathered, that the <hi>image of God</hi> with which he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did conſiſt in the ſuperiority that he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all other creatures; nevertheleſſe, by that which it ſeems to me S. Paul felt, and that which I ſee fulfilled in Chriſt, and feel and ſee begun in them that are the members of Chriſt, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that beſides the ſuperiority which the Scripture notes, man was like unto God, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as belongs to his mind, in piety, juſtice, and holineſſe, and as much as belongs to his body in impaſſibility and in immortality. In this I certifie my ſelf, remembring that we reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by Chriſt that which we loſt by Adam. We loſt by Adam, piety, juſtice, and holineſſe, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:99333:139"/> we loſt the impaſſibility and immortality of our bodies; and by Chriſt we ſhall in this life reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver piety, juſtice, and holineſſe in our minds, and we ſhall recover in eternall life the impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and immortality of our bodies. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſee Chriſt being raiſed impaſsible and immortall, I have ſaid, that I ſee in him that complete and perfect <hi>image of God</hi> which man loſt. And becauſe I feel that they who are the members of Chriſt being regenerated by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, have piety, juſtice, and holineſſe. I have ſaid, that in them I ſee the <hi>image of God</hi> begun to be repaired, which the firſt man loſt,</p>
               <p>Of that <hi>image of God</hi> which man pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, albeit from holy Scripture I cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it conſiſted but onely in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil; nevertheleſſe by that which I conſider in every of thoſe men, who have not obtained the Chriſtian regeneration; and properly by that which even they who have obtained it do feel in themſelves, &amp; know of themſelves; I underſtand that beſides the knowledge of good and evil, which holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture notes, man pretended unto that <hi>image of God,</hi> which conſiſteth in the proper being of God, who is of himſelf, and gives being and life to every thing that is, and lives, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loves himſelf, and for himſelf loves all things, and would be loved for himſelf and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, and hath majeſtie, and glory, and omnipotency.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:99333:140"/>
               <p>This I think underſtanding thus, that ſince there yet lives in a man that curſed perſwaſion of the enemy of humane kind, there yet lives a raſh pretence to obtain that image of God, which onely appertains to God, not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to the creatures.</p>
               <p>Whence as I underſtand it proceeds, that a man will not depend on others, but on himſelf, to which things he attends as much as is poſſible for him; and that he loves himſelf, and loves all things for himſelf; and pretends in every of his own matters his own proper glory, and would put in execution every thing that comes into his appetite. And from this fountain I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, proceed in a man thoſe other things, which are annexed unto theſe, ſuch as are proper eſtimation, ambition, vain-glory, anger, envy. And I underſtand, that in thoſe men who have obtained Chriſtian regeneration by Chriſt, ſo much doth the pretence to Gods image which belongs not to them, go abating, as much as they go recovering that which belongs to them; in ſuch manner, that as piety, juſtice and holineſſe go increaſing in them, ſo doth ſelf-love, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and proper eſtimation, arrogancy, and their own raſhneſſe go decreaſing: The incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith they ſtand incorporated in Chriſt working this ſingular effect in them, from which it comes that they are humble and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſonnes, not preſumptuous nor diſobedient, as was the firſt man.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:99333:140"/>
               <p>To underſtand this better, I ſet my ſelf to conſider between God and man, the devil and Chriſt, the ſame as between a father and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſonne, an evil ſlave and an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſonne. And I underſtand, that God did with man giving him his image and ſimilitude, that which a father doth with his ſonne, giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in his houſe authority ſuch as belongs to a ſonne. And that man did with God, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the image of God, that which a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſonne doth with his father, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents not himſelf with that degree which he hath in his fathers houſe as a ſonne, but pretends and wills the degree which his father, hath: And that the devil did that to man, perſwading him to become diſobedient, which an evil ſlave doth toward his maſter, procuring to ſever his ſonne from his obedience, to do him diſpleaſure, and to ruine him. And I underſtand that Chriſt did with God, in contenting himſelf that on him ſhould be executed the juſtice of God, that which an obedient ſonne doth with his father, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf that his father ſhould chaſtize him for that, for which he ought to chaſtize the other diſobedient ſonne, to reduce him to his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to reſtore unto him in his houſe that degree and that dignity which belongs to a ſon. From all that is ſaid, I take two reſolutions: The firſt, that it belongs to the pious Chriſtian to deſiſt from the pretence of that image and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:99333:141"/> of God, which belongs not to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing every deſire to know, all ſelf-love, all ambition, all proper eſteem, all arrogancy, and all preſumption; and to attend to recover intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that image and ſimilitude of God which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains unto him, demanding of God greater piety, greater juſtice, and greater holineſſe, and demanding of him impaſſibility, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. The ſecond, that to the pious Chriſtian it belongs to know his reparation from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt, and to know his depravation from the diſobedience of Adam, and ſo to leave to imitate Adam, &amp; to attend to imitate Chriſt: <hi>Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, taking upon him the form of a ſervant; for which cauſe God hath exalted him, and given him abſolute power and ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie in heaven and in earth.</hi> So much did avail before God the obedience and the humility of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>In the mean while I underſtand, that a pious perſon, who by the liberality of God begins to know God, and to love God, and to ſtand uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, ought to pretend to grow in the knowledge, in the love, and in the union, not judging himſelf deprived of the knowledge, nor of the love, nor of the union with God, whileſt he finds in himſelf any part of true knowledge, any part of love, any part of union.</p>
               <p>The true and efficacious knowledge of God, as I haue otherwhere ſaid, as I underſtand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in certain taſts, &amp; in certain knowledges of the being of God, which pious perſons do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſome more, ſome leſſe, ſome with greater evidence, ſome with leſſe, according to the will of God, which cauſeth the taſts and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, of which they can onely give teſtimony who have taſted them, nay they onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this language, it being to all others alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unintelligible; it being moſt true which S. Paul ſaith, that <hi>a man without the ſpirit of God, doth not underſtand the things that are of the ſpirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true and efficacious love of God I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand conſiſts in an affection from the very bowels which a man bears to God, and to all thoſe things that are Gods, deſiring that he ſhould be known, loved, and prized in the world, in ſuch manner as is juſt: To the intent that he ſhould be known, loved, and prized
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:99333:142"/> with this bowelly affection, I underſtand Chriſt willeth that his Chriſtians ſhould ſay that firſt part of <hi>Our Father,</hi> which all appertains to the glory of God. From this bowelly affection I underſtand it proceeds, that a man loves God above all things, loving every thing for God, the creatures in generall, inaſmuch as they are the creatures of God; all men, inaſmuch as they be the creatures of God, and inaſmuch as God wills that our neighbour ſhould be loved; (and our neighbour is every man, of what bloud ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſtate or condition;) and men regenerated by the holy ſpirit as the creatures of God, as neighbours, and principally inaſmuch as in them is ſeen &amp; known the image and likenes of God.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the creatures the man that loves God, loves them moſt who do moſt illuſtrate the glory of God. And amongſt men whom he loves as neighbours, he loveth them moſt, whom he ſees leſſe depraved, and leſſe impious. And I ſay leſſe, underſtanding that in all men, who are not regenerated by the holy Spirit, there is found depravation and impiety. Amongſt rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated men he who loves God, for the love of God loves them moſt whom he ſees and knows to be moſt conformable to the image and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of God, and in whom he ſees this image more proper, and more naturall. And a man who loves God, loves himſelf as the creature of God, as a neighbour, and inaſmuch as he ſees
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99333:143"/> the ſimilitude and image of God reformed in himſelf; not procuring, nor willing in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner to be loved for himſelf; but rather deſpiſing, and abhorring the love that men bear him, when they do not love him for the love of God. In this manner I underſtand, that a man who loves God, loves himſelf for the love of God, and loves all things for the love of God. And further I underſtand, that a man who loves himſelf above all things, loves God for reſpect of himſelf; and this man pretends his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in the love of God: he loves in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the creatures, loving them more from whom he expects more profit: he loves all men in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelf, loving them moſt which are moſt profitable, and moſt neceſſary: and he loves in reſpect of himſelf, the men whom he thinks to have obtained the Chriſtian regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loving them moſt by means of whom he pretends to be able to get piety, juſtice, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity. And reſolutely he pretends and procure to be loved for himſelf, and to be loved above all things, which as I have at other times ſaid is naturall to a man, inaſmuch as he pretends to get that image which belongs not to him. And here I underſtand that a man, who reduceth himſelf to a deſire of not being beloved but for the love of God, finding moleſtation in the love which is born towards him for himſelf, may judge to have made great profit in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99333:143"/> of God, in the love of God, and in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. Of this ſort and quality, as I underſtand, is the love which men have, who are united with God, which as I underſtand is in part in a man in this preſent life, and ſhall be entire in life everlaſting. And he who ſhall feel any thing of this part, hath great reaſon to live joyfull and content, holding that part as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of his increaſe, and of his perfection in life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>The true and efficacious <hi>union between God and man,</hi> conſiſts in this, that S John ſaith, <hi>that he who loves God, dwels in God, and God dwels in him.</hi> Gods dwelling in a man may well be felt, as it is in truth felt; but to them who feel it not, it cannot be made to be underſtood. The ſame may as it were be ſaid of mans dwelling in God. And I ſay, as it were, becauſe it ſeems that it may be made to be underſtood, ſaying, that he who loveth God, ſtands united with God, abides in God, alwayes remembring God; even like as he who loving a creature ſtands u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with it, abides in it, alwayes remembring himſelf of it. It is very true, that not thus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the dwelling of man in God underſtood.</p>
               <p>For this union I undeſtand Chriſt our Lord prayed unto his eternall and heavenly Father, demanding of him, that they who were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, ſhould be one with him, and with the Father himſelf, and ſhould be one between themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:99333:144"/>
               <p>From this divine union it proceeds, that a man altogether, and in all things remits himſelf to the will of God, renouncing his own proper will, and ſo brings himſelf to will that which God wills, and in that manner which God wills, to love that which God loves, and in that manner which God loves it, and conſequently not to will that which God wills not, and not to love that which God loves not. And the man that is thus remitted and thus reduced, may hold for certain that he ſtands united with God, and that he dwells in God, and God in him. And he ſhall underſtand, that he ſo farre ſtands uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, as farre as he ſtands thus remitted, and thus reduced. If he ſtand much, the union is much; if little, the union is little.</p>
               <p>It proceeds alſo from this divine Union, that a man likes and diſlikes all thoſe things which thoſe perſons like and diſlike, who ſtand in the ſame Union; in ſuch manner, that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them a very great conformity in wills; and ſo great is the conformity which is between them, as the union is great which they have with God, and between themſelves. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity is likewiſe a good counterſigne, with which a man may certifie himſelf, whether he ſtand united with God, and how much of this union he hath gotten.</p>
               <p>Having underſtood how the <hi>union between God and man</hi> is made by <hi>love;</hi> and that <hi>love</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:99333:144"/> grows from that knowledge which a man hath of God. And having likewiſe underſtood in what the <hi>union,</hi> and the <hi>love,</hi> and the <hi>knowledge</hi> do conſiſt, I come to reſolve my ſelf in this, that to that perſon which attends unto piety, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to attend to obtain the <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> and with the <hi>knowledge</hi> the <hi>love,</hi> and with the <hi>love</hi> the <hi>union.</hi> Attending to obtain all this by the liberality of God, and exerciſing himſelf in knowing himſelf, I mean the frail and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being of man; and to diſenamour himſelf of himſelf, not willing to be loved for himſelf, and procuring to be loved for God; and in diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf from himſelf, not willing to have things according to his own phantaſie and will, but as God ſhall offer them to him either by himſelf, or by means of men, or by means of the creatures. And thus ſhall he obtain the perfect <hi>knowledge of God,</hi> the perfect <hi>love of God,</hi> and the perfect <hi>union with God.</hi> But not now in this preſent life; for the fleſh except it be raiſed up, is not a fitting ſubject for this; but in life everlaſting, where the fleſh being raiſed up ſhall be an able ſubject to be as it ſhall be like unto the glorious fleſh, with which Chriſt Jeſus our Lord aroſe.</p>

               <p>TO the perſon that begins to underſtand ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and divine things, and that begins to to know them, I underſtand that befalls which befalls thoſe perſons, who having by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident loſt the ſight of their eyes, begin to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. I ſay, that as thoſe perſons go knowing the being of things, according as they go reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the ſight of their eyes; firſt confuſedly, as it befell to the <hi>blind man</hi> in the Goſpel, who beginning to <hi>open his eyes ſaw men, and it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him that they were trees;</hi> and afterwards leſſe confuſedly, untill ſuch time as by little and little they come to ſee, and know things in their own proper being.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner theſe perſons go on know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirituall and divine things, accordingly as they go purifying their minds with faith, and with love, and with union with God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they know them confuſedly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards leſſe confuſedly, and ſo by little and little they go advancing in the knowledge of them, untill ſuch time as they arrive and come to know God, and the things that are Gods, in that manner which may be in this preſent life. And hence, as I underſtand, it proceeds, that that thing which a perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99333:145"/> the ſpirit holds for holy, and juſt, and good, in the things of God; another perſon who hath the ſpirit, condemns and reputes defective and evil. And hence it likewiſe proceeds, that that which a perſon, who hath little of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, holds for moſt certain, another who hath more ſpirit then he, holds for an errour. Going on thus from one ſtep to another, the clearneſſe of that judgement increaſeth which ſpirituall perſons have of divine matters.

               <p>Furthermore I underſtand, that it belongs to every pious perſon to be very modeſt, and very moderate in approving or condemning things wherein God is pleaſed or diſpleaſed, conſidering that the judgement which God makes of things is very different from that which men make, how ſpirituall ſoever they be: inaſmuch as oft-times a perſon that hath much

               <p>WIlling to underſtand in what manner we, who are the members of Chriſt, do ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all the things of God by Chriſt, I conſider, that as all men, who have the outward ſight of the eyes clear, do know the outward being of things through the benefit of the Sunne, in which God hath ſet his outward light: ſo all men who have the ſight of their inward eyes clear, do know all inward things by the benefit of Chriſt, in whom as Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>God hath ſet all the treaſures of his Divinity:</hi> I ſay, that as God having ſet all the outward light in the Sunne, the Sun it ſelf ſends forth his beams, which work his effect, and are effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious in thoſe which are fit to receive it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as onely thoſe living creatures are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the benefit of the Sun, to whom eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight is wanting, and they who ſhut themſelves up in caves, or dens, whereinto the Sun-beams
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99333:146"/> cannot pierce: in the ſame manner, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put in Chriſt all the <hi>treaſures of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> Chriſt poures out his treaſures upon them, who being men are clothed with the ſame livery, with which he was clothed; which trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are efficacious in thoſe perſons, which God hath drawn unto the knowledge of Chriſt, and ſo they are members of Chriſt, they onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived of this divine influence who have not the knowledge of God, and conſequently are not pious, and who have not the knowledge of Chriſt, and conſequently are not juſt; for in them onely the <hi>divine treaſures,</hi> which Chriſt poures out upon men, are not efficacious; they ſtanding as much deprived of the ſenſe, and knowledge of them, as he who is born blind ſtands deprived of the ſenſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the light of the Sun. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that as it appertains to him who finds himſelf in this privation, to pray God, that he would open and clear the ſight of his eyes, in ſuch ſort that he alſo may enjoy the light of the Sunne, inaſmuch as the Sunne of its own ſelf lets it ſelf to be enjoyed: ſo in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to him who feels not in himſelf the gifts of God, which are communicated unto men by Chriſt, it appertains to pray God, that he would inable him, and that he would purifie him, in ſuch ſort as he may become a good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to receive the <hi>divine treaſures</hi> efficaciouſly,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99333:147"/> which Chriſt poures out upon all men, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God hath for all, put them in him, and he generally poures them out upon all men, as Saint John very well underſtood, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>of that which abounds in Chriſt, we all, who are his members receive grace, and more grace:</hi> Inaſmuch as God by the means of Moſes gave unto us the law only, but by means of Jeſus Chriſt he gives <hi>grace unto us,</hi> Juſtifying us in the Juſtice executed on Chriſt himſelf; and he gives unto us truth, giving unto us his ſpirit, which teacheth us every truth. And becauſe all theſe divine gifts do come, and ſhall come unto men in this life from Chriſt, and he gives them unto them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates them unto them, it is rightly ſaid, that this is the kingdome of Chriſt, and that it ſhall ſo long laſt, untill the reſurrection of the juſt being made, Chriſt reſigne the kingdome to his everlaſting Father. God reignes at preſent, but by Chriſt, even as God ſends his light but by the Sun: and in the life eternall God ſhall reigne by himſelf, and communicate his light. I ſay, that in the life eternall all divine gifts ſhall come immediately from God unto men, and from God ſhall come light immediately unto men. In this manner underſtanding the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Chriſt towards men, and the kingdome of Chriſt in this preſent life; I underſtand like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe after what ſort Chriſt is the <hi>Head of the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99333:147"/> Church,</hi> that as from my head there deſcends virtue throughout all my members, they being all governed, and ſuſtained by it: ſo from Chriſt deſcends virtue for all them that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Church, being all of them ſuſtained, and governed with the divine gifts which are communicated to them from Chriſt. And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they appertain to the Church, who being called of God, and drawn to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, are able to receive with efficacy the <hi>divine treaſures,</hi> which the onely begotten ſon of God Chriſt Jeſus our Lord ſheds upon all.</p>

                  <p>What ſcandall is, and in what manner Christian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ought to govern themſelves in the caſe of Scandall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>COnſidering how much eſteem is made in holy Scripture of <hi>Scandall,</hi> inaſmuch as Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord threatens the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of <hi>ſcandall,</hi> adviſing us that we ſhould give <hi>ſcandall</hi> to none of thoſe who believe in him; And inaſmuch as Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>that for the avoiding of ſcandalizing of one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, he would forbear to eat fleſh all the time of his life:</hi> I have deſired to live in this life in ſuch ſort, that I be not cauſe of <hi>ſcandall</hi> to any: And I have deſired the ſame for thoſe perſons whom I love in Chriſt. And conſidering that on the other ſide a man cannot live in this life without ſcandalizing ſome; foraſmuch as even
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99333:148"/> Chriſt himſelf ſcandalized; nay he is even cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>rock of offence,</hi> inaſmuch as many have fallen ſtumbling at his humility, and abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and do fall without being able to riſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt I have conſidered, that <hi>ſcandall</hi> is the ſame as <hi>offence;</hi> and ſo we ſay, that he is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, who for that which he hears or ſees done, ſevers himſelf, or is ſolicited, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to ſever himſelf, from that which he ought not, or would not ſever himſelf.</p>
               <p>Afterward I have underſtood by holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that God ſcandalizeth, and is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized; that Gods Saints ſcandalize and are ſcandalized; that the<note n="*" place="margin">By the Saints of the world he every where underſtands the cunning hypocrite who by the world is counted a very Saint, for his outward ſhew of holineſſe: and we meet with two ſorts of theſe Saints of the world; one, whoſe holineſſe conſiſts in a few ceremonious and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious obſervations; the others, in a zeal againſt theſe, and in a ſtrict performance of a few cheap and eaſie duties of religion, with no leſſe ſuperſtition; both of them having forms or vizars of godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof.</note> Saints of the world ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize, and are ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and that the men of the world, who do not attend to any holineſſe, ſcandalize, but are not ſcandalized.</p>
               <p>God ſcandaliſeth his Saints, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imperfect, and ſetting themſelves with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light to judge the works of God, are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to judge evil of God, or not to believe the providence of God. That this is true appears by the 73. Pſalm, <hi>Truly God is loving unto Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> God likewiſe ſcandalizeth the Saints of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:99333:148"/> the world in all things that are not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to humane reaſon. For they having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then naturall light, and judging them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, they do tax and condemne them for evil. And hence it proceeds, that with difficulty they bring themſelves to be willing to attribute par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular providence to God, and that they will not admit predeſtination, except after their own way,</p>
               <p>They who judge the works of God with ſpirituall light, God never ſcandalizeth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor them who captivate their underſtandings to God: Neither doth God ſcandalize the men of the world, for they keep no account with God, believing that all things come by chance.</p>
               <p>God is ſcandalized, or tempted to do that which he would not, being as he is, mercifull; and pitifull, when they, who he holds for his own, and favours as his own, diſtruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of his promiſes, or of his omnipotency and providence, inaſmuch as with their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they provoke him to puniſh them, as it were againſt his will. In this manner the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews in the Deſart ſcandalized him, as appears by the hiſtory, and by the 78. and 95. Pſalms.</p>
               <p>God is alſo ſcandalized from the Saints of the world with the arrogancy, and preſumption with which they ſell themſelves for Gods ſaints, for which God is forced to puniſh them with blindneſſe as he puniſhed the Hebrews, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:99333:149"/> falſe Chriſtians. And God is ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed from the impious, when with their ſins and vices they ſhew, and diſcover the impiety and infidelity of their minds, inaſmuch as he is as it were neceſſitated to deſtroy them, as appears by many places of holy Scripture, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that which S. Paul ſaith, Rom. 1.</p>
               <p>The Saints of God ſcandalize God in the manner that hath been ſpoken of; and they ſcandalize one another, when they that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect uſe more liberty then is fit in the preſence of the imperfect, through which liberty the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect are tempted to make an evil judgement of the Chriſtian faith, or to do as the perfect do, not knowing that they do amiſſe. From this ſort of ſcandall Saint Paul had intent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to keep himſelf, as appears, Rom. 14. and 1 Cor. 8. the ſame ſcandalize the Saints of the world, when they do not conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with them in the things which to their ſeeming are religion, and ſanctitie. So the Scribes and Phariſees were ſcandalized at Chriſt, as appears, Matth. 15. And the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews were ſcandalized at S. Paul, as appears by this, that even unto this preſent day the ſaints of the world are ſcandalized at the Epiſtles which S. Paul writ, judging them hurtfull to Chriſtian living. And ſo a man may ſay, that the Saints of the world have ſtumbled, and do ſtumble at Chriſt, and at true Chriſtians,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99333:149"/> and at their actions, and ſo much the more as they be the more like unto Chriſt. Of this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall Chriſtians that are the Saints of God are to take little care, as Chriſt himſelf took little care, ſaying, <hi>Let them alone, they are blind leaders of the blind,</hi> Matth. 15. The men of the world are not ſcandalized by the Saints of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they come in no competition with them. The Saints of God are ſcandalized from God through their imperfection, and by means of the ſame imperfection, the imperfect are ſcandalized from the perfect, as hath been ſaid. The Saints of God are ſcandalized by the Saints of the world, by being falſely doctrinated and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, and being by them perſecuted with detraction, with evil intreaties, and with death, they are ſolicited to depart from the Goſpel, and from Chriſt. This is that ſcandall for which Chriſt threatens the world, and from which Chriſt exhorteth every one to keep himſelf, Matth. 18.</p>
               <p>The Saints of God are likewiſe ſcandalized by wicked men, though they buy their own ſcandall, for ſeeing in them the works of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and incredulity, they are tempted to the ſame, or are moleſted by them. In this manner was Lot ſcandalized with the <hi>filthineſſe of the men of Sodome,</hi> as appeareth 2. Pet. 2.7. And the Saints of the world ſcandalize God, and the Saints of God in that manner as hath been ſaid.
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:99333:150"/> And they themſelves are ſcandalized from God, and by the Saints of God, in that manner as hath been ſaid. The ſame are ſcandalized one at another, inaſmuch as it would be a wonder to find one that approves anothers manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, a thing which is naturall to the holineſſe of the world, which conſiſteth in ſuperſtitious obſervations. The ſame are ſcandalized from the men of the world, inaſmuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves with them in nothing. The men of the world ſcandalize God, and the Saints of the world in that manner as hath been ſpoken; but themſelves are never ſcandalized in any kind: for they keep no account with God, nor with religion, nor with piety.</p>
               <p>There is indeed a generation of men in the world, who through the converſation which they have with the Saints of the world, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain manner of holineſſe, are ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized as the Saints of the world are ſcandalized, albeit they be not ſo pernicious as the Saints of the world.</p>
               <p>From this I come to gather this reſolution, that every Chriſtian ought to attend to form in himſelf a mind ſo like unto God, and unto Chriſt, that he ſhould altogether be ſcandalized at thoſe things at which God is ſcandalized; that is, at the diffidence and doubtfulneſſe of them who are the Saints of God, but imperfect; at the arrogancy of the Saints of the world;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:99333:150"/> and at the vices and ſinnes with which the men of the world do manifeſt the impiety and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of their minds; and that it appertains to him to attend to form his living ſo like to the life of our Lord Chriſt, that he do not in any manner ſcandalize God, diſtruſting or doubting of his promiſes, or of his omnipotency and providence; nor ſcandalize the Saints of God in any thing, eſteeming little to ſcandalize the Saints of the world, when the glory of God comes between the Chriſtian truth, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the profit of the Saints of God, as Chriſt did, as appears Matth. 15. and as S. Paul did, and as they have done and do from time to time, who have followed and imitated, and do follow and imitate Chriſt. Let the Saints of the world ſtumble and fall, and break their necks rather then the truth of the Goſpel ſuffer any detriment in the Saints of God. Whereupon if any ſhall doubt, ſaying, How ſhall I govern my ſelf, when I ſhall be forced to ſcandalize either the Saints of God, which are imperfect in being ſuperſtitious, or the Saints of God which were never ſuperſtitious? I ſhall ſay unto him, that he ought to beware of doing as S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did in <hi>Antioch,</hi> Gal. 2.11, 12, &amp;c. who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more reſpect to them that were ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſcandalized, and cauſed them <hi>to ſtumble who had never been ſuperstitious.</hi> I would ſay, that having reſpect to the ſuperſtition, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:99333:151"/> of the converts from Judaiſme, he did ſcandalize, and put in hazard the ſincerity of the faith of the converts from gentility, feigning the obſervation of the Law againſt the rule of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith. And I will ſay unto him, that he ought to do as S. Paul did at the ſame time, who having more reſpect that the faith of thoſe of the Gentility ſhould not be ſcandalized, then the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of them of the Judaiſme, did publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprove S. Peter. I ſay, that if a Chriſtian that underſtands the Evangelicall Goſpel, and knows Chriſtian verity, ſhall find himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt perſons that begin to underſtand, and know them, he ſhall do well to accommodate himſelf to their incapacity and frailty, doing as they do. And I further ſay, that in caſe he be hereby carefully intending to draw them to the knowledge of the Evangelicall faith and truth, where there is both the one and the other ſort of perſons, if he ſhall think that diſſembling with them that do as yet keep any part of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, he ſhall ſcandalize, and make them fall who are free from ſuperſtition, inaſmuch as ſeeing him in the ſuperſtition, they may come to hold the ſuperſtition for neceſſary, he ought not to diſſemble in any manner, although he ſhould think to put his life in danger; having alwayes regard that the Chriſtian faith and the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall truth ſtand firms and conſtant. Here I will adde this, that when a Chriſtian ſcandalizeth a
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99333:151"/> Chriſtian who knows the Evangelicall truth, becauſe he would not ſcandalize another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, who as yet doth not well underſtand it, if his errour proceed from covetouſneſſe, or from ambition, becauſe the one is richer or more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull then the other, his errour is intolerable. And if his errour proceed from indiſcretion, or from weaknes and infirmity, it is tolerable.</p>
               <p>By that which hath been ſaid I learn theſe thirteen things;</p>
               <p n="1">1. What Scandall is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That to the intent I be not ſcandalized at the works of God, it is needfull to renounce my wiſdome, and my humane reaſon, and to pray to God that he give me ſpirituall light, with which I may underſtand his works.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That I do then ſcandalize God, when I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt his promiſes, his omnipotency &amp; providence</p>
               <p n="4">4. That I ought to refrain, as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to uſe my Chriſtian liberty in preſence of weak Chriſtians that are infirm in the faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That I ought lightly to eſteem the <hi>ſcandal</hi> that the ſaints of the world take at the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the <hi>ſcandall</hi> that is pernicious to him who ſcandalizeth, is that which the ſaints of the world do, pretending to do ſervice unto God. And here I learn, that I ought to keep my ſelf as from the fire to perſecute any man in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſoever, pretending to do God ſervice therein.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:99333:152"/>7. That I ought to hold it for a good ſigne of piety, when the works of impiety, &amp; of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the men of the world do ſcandalize me.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That it is a good ſigne to know the ſaints of the world, by their being often and eaſily ſcandalized by any perſon, and their publiſhing and ſhewing of their <hi>ſcandall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. That it is a ſigne of impiety for a man not to be offended nor ſcandalized in any thing.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That it becomes me to be like God, and Chriſt in the inward, to the end I be not ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized but by that wherewith God and Chriſt are ſcandalized.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That it becomes me to live like Chriſt, that I may not ſcandalize but as Chriſt did.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That for no cauſe I ought to ſcandalize any in prejudice of the Chriſtian faith, although I do know that I ſcandalize the weakneſſe and infirmity of imperfect Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="13">13. That I learn, that having ſcandalized in prejudice of the Chriſtian faith through indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or weakneſſe, my errour will be tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but when I ſhall ſcandalize in prejudice of the ſame through covetouſneſſe, or ambition my errour will be intolerable. And from this errour I am certain my God will preſerve me, and all thoſe whom he hath called to the acceptation of the grace of the Goſpel, to be heirs with Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>COnſidering that men who <hi>live according to the fleſh,</hi> while they think not of it, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve little, have leſſe confidence, and love much leſſe, as they themſelves well know and feel, and accordingly ſhew it in their words, although they would not ſhew it. And conſidering that when they take themſelves into conſideration, they perſwade themſelves that they believe much, and have much confidence and love: And conſidering on the other ſide, that thoſe who <hi>live according to the ſpirit,</hi> although they ſeem regardleſſe and think not of it, believe, have confidence, and love more or leſſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that part of the ſpirit which they have; as they themſelves know and feel in themſelves, and as they ſhew in their words, ſpeaking with more piety, faith, confidence, and affection of the things of God, when they ordinarily ſpeak, and when the force of the ſpirit moves them to ſpeak of piety, faith, confidence, and love, then all the men of the world together, when they ſet themſelves with diligence and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſpeak thereof. And conſidering alſo that it cometh oftentimes to paſſe, that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon examination of themſelves cannot bring themſelves to believe, nor leſſe to have
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99333:153"/> confidence, and much leſſe to love: I have ſet my ſelf to underſtand, whence theſe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects proceed. And I find, that one part proceeds from that which Chriſt ſaith, Luke 6, 45. that <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> Whence it comes to paſſe, that he who <hi>lives according to the fleſh,</hi> having in his heart neither faith, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, nor love, cannot give of that which he hath not; and conſequently cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſet himſelf purpoſely thereunto, make ſhew of faith, confidence, or love. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he who <hi>lives according to the spirit,</hi> hath in his heart piety, faith, confidence and love, and being able to give of that which he hath; it is neceſſary how careleſſe ſoever he ſeem to be, that he ſhould yield forth pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, faith, confidence, and love. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the holy Scripture, Proverbs 10.11. calls the <hi>juſt mans mouth a vein or mine of life.</hi> And I find likewiſe, that the other part of theſe contrarieties proceeds from this, that the man <hi>who lives after the fleſh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he keeps no account with his heart, doth then perſwade himſelf that he believes, hath confidence, and that he loves, when he hath the faith, confidence, and the love in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. He knoweth that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for a Chriſtian, that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, have confidence, and love; and he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99333:153"/> himſelf, that he believes, hath confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and loves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he knows and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands that he ought to do ſo. But they <hi>who live according to the ſpirit,</hi> becauſe they keep account with their hearts, not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to hold the faith, confidence, and love in their underſtandings, cannot perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they believe, have confidence, or love, but when they feel in their hearts the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of confidence, and love. And becauſe this ſenſe and feeling is through the favour of God, who gives it not when men would, but when it pleaſeth his Divine Majeſty, hence it comes to paſſe that thoſe who <hi>live after the Spirit,</hi> do then find moſt difficulty in believing, loving, and having confidence, when they do moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly go about to procure it. Whence it may be gathered, that the ſigne of what a man hath within him, is to be taken from that which he ſhewes outwardly, and ordinarily when he is regardleſſe. And further, that through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, or difficulty, with which a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades himſelf to believe, have confidence, and love, it may be known, whether his faith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and love, be in the head and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding onely, or in the heart alſo. And ſo this concluſion is made, that they who while they think not of it, ſpeak moſt Chriſtianly; and when they would bring themſelves with humane induſtry to have confidence, to believe,

               </argument>
               <p>AS Saint Paul puts <hi>two griefs,</hi> 2 Cor. 7, 10. one according to the <hi>world,</hi> and ſaith, that this <hi>cauſeth death;</hi> and the other according to <hi>God,</hi> and ſaith, that this <hi>cauſeth life:</hi> Even ſo I put <hi>two weakneſſes,</hi> one according to the <hi>fleſh;</hi> and I underſtand, that this cauſeth fear; and another according to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and that this cauſeth <hi>love.</hi> And I put them, becauſe I feel them in the <hi>griefes</hi> which Saint Paul puts; I underſtand that then a man feels grief according to the world, when he falls into ſome ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, as cauſeth ſhame, or loſſe, or any other diſcommodity in the eyes of the world, in the reputation and dignitie of the world. And I underſtand, that this <hi>grief cauſeth death,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as a man that grieves in this manner, except he ſpeedily remedy his grief, becomes blaſphemous againſt God, attributing unto him the cauſe of his grief, and lamenting it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemous againſt God, he comes to get himſelf eternall death. So I underſtand, that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99333:154"/> then a man feels grief according to God, when he falls into any inconvenience, by reaſon whereof he fears to be deprived of the grace of God, and of the holy ſpirit of Chriſt, and of God himſelf. And I underſtand, that this grief cauſeth life, inaſmuch as he who is grieved in this manner, doth more, and better know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo doth more cordially recommend and remit himſelf to God, and from this recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending himſelf to God, he comes to attain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and life everlaſting,</p>
               <p>For the <hi>two weakneſſes</hi> which I put, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that a man is then weak according to the fleſh, when his weakneſſe grows from ſelf love: And I call this a weakneſſe, to reſent himſelf for thoſe things, which come to paſſe againſt his will. This weakneſſe I underſtand cauſeth fear: for where ſelf love is, there is alwayes fear. And I underſtand that this weakneſſe is tolerable in Chriſtians, being no ſigne of impiety, but of imperfection. Alſo I underſtand that a man is then weak according to the ſpirit, when his weakneſſe grows from the love of God, reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf, when he ſees himſelf deprived of God, or of any of the things that are of God, which are means to him to grow in the love of God, and in the confidence in God. This weakneſſe I underſtand cauſeth love, becauſe it proceeds from love, and ſo is converted into love, and is therefore laudable, and a ſigne of Chriſtian perfection.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:99333:155"/>
               <p>Weakneſſe according to the fleſh, but not blame worthy, I underſtand was that which Saint Paul Rom. 9.2. felt for the <hi>reprobation of the Hebrews.</hi> And weakneſſe according to the ſpirit, I underſtand was that which Saint Paul, 2 Cor. 12.7. felt through the <hi>thorns in the fleſh;</hi> and that which he felt Phil. 2.27. for the <hi>ſickneſſe unto death</hi> of his friend. And that alſo was weakneſſe according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which they of <hi>Miletum</hi> felt for the <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Saint Paul.</hi> Acts 20, 37.38.</p>
               <p>Whence I gather, that Chriſtians ought not to grieve themſelves much in their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that are according to the fleſh, ſince in them they be tolerable; for they are not mortall: And that Chriſtians ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce much in their weakneſſes which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit, inaſmuch as they are ſignes of perfection, and the way of vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of Reſurrection, and of eternall life.</p>
               <p>The children of this world feel the grief that is according to the world, but they do not feel the grief which is according to God: and the ſonnes of God feel the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grief; the one, inaſmuch as Adam lives in them, and the other, inaſmuch as Chriſt lives in them.</p>
               <p>The children of this world have indeed the weakneſſe that is according to the fleſh, but all
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99333:155"/> of them do not know it for weakneſſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feel it as ſuch. The weakneſſe which is according to the ſpirit, they neither have, know, nor feel. And the ſonnes of God have, know, and feel both the weakneſſes, knowing in the weakneſſe that is according to the fleſh, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of the old Adam; and in the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is according to the ſpirit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation of the new Adam our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>How perillous the errours be, which men commit, pretending piety.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Hold that amongſt thoſe errours, which we, who are the ſonnes of God, by committing may offend God, the greateſt are thoſe, which are committed <hi>pretending piety.</hi> That this is true, I ſee as well by the rigorouſneſſe, with which God hath puniſhed theſe errours as it is read in holy Scripture; as alſo becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Scripture, that God hath with his hand (as it were) reſtrained them who have been his, not conſenting that they ſhould fall into theſe kind of errours; not having done the ſame in other errours, wherein they have had intention to ſatisfie their appetites, and affections.</p>
               <p>Of the rigourouſneſſe, with which God hath puniſhed them who haue erred preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:99333:156"/> piety, he might principally give teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who willing to <hi>hold up the Ark of the Testimony,</hi> 2 Sam. 6.6, 7. which to his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming was about to fall, died inſtantly: And <hi>Saul</hi> who was <hi>deprived of the kingdome of Iſrael,</hi> and perpetually of the grace of God, for the ſacrifice that he made to God for the victory that he had againſt certain nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which God had given him command, <hi>that he ſhould not leave any thing alive, which ſhould not paſſe the edge of the ſword,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.</p>
               <p>Whereupon if any ſhall demand, ſaying, Why then hath not God uſed the ſame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſneſſe with others, who have erred more perniciouſly, pretending piety, as a man might ſay of Saint Paul, who before he was a Chriſtian, pretending pietie perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſlew the Chriſtians? I will make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Firſt, that hitherto God hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me the account thereof. And I will ſay, that God doth not uſe this rigorouſneſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept with them, who are of the number of his. And Saint Paul when he was in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, was not in the number of thoſe who were Gods; the Hebrew people having then left to be the people of God; and therefore his errour was not puniſhed as that of Uzzahs, nor as that of Sauls.</p>
               <p>That God hath reſtrained with his hand
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:99333:156"/> his elect, not ſuffering them to erre in piety, albeit he have ſuffered them to erre in other things; ſerves me for a moſt effectuall example that which is written of David, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding piety, deſired to <hi>build the Temple of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and God did not conſent thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, becauſe it was not his will, that he ſhould build it unto him; and therefore he ſhould have erred, if he had builded it. And the ſame pretending to ſatisfie his appetites with Bathſheba, <hi>cauſed her husband to be ſlain,</hi> and did with the wife what pleaſed him; to which matter God ſet no impediment at all.</p>
               <p>In like manner Saint Peter not pretending piety <hi>denyed Chriſt,</hi> and God permitted it; and pretending piety he would not <hi>converſe with the Gentiles,</hi> and God did not permit it. As likewiſe he did not conſent to it, that Saint Paul <hi>ſhould go,</hi> where he pretending piety would have gone, untill that pretence of his became not his, but of the holy ſpirit which abode in him.</p>
               <p>And I hold it certain, that the moſt continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ordinary temptation, with which pious perſons are tempted is this of pretending piety, in which the <hi>angel of Satan transfigures him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> making that to ſeem piety, which is no piety. But pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may comfort themſelves with two things: the one is, that againſt the temptations of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:99333:157"/> angels of Satan, they have the illuminations of the holy ſpirit, who diſcovers the deceit of the malignant ſpirit. And the other is, that God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to reſtrain with his hand the pious, that they ſhould not fall into this kind of errour, it being ſo much contrary unto true piety. And together herewith, the pious ought alwayes to ſtand watchfull, ſo as the <hi>angell of Satan com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing transfigured into an Angel of light,</hi> they may know him, and guard themſelves from him.</p>
               <p>Three things here offer themſelves to me. The firſt, ſeeing the errour is ſo great, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by men pretending piety, every man ought to go with more regard to do thoſe things with which he pretends piety, then to do things with which he pretends his proper ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that thoſe who are elected of God, do not erre pretending piety through the illuminations which they have of the holy ſpirit, and becauſe God reſtrains them with his hand. It is a great ſigne of piety, and of the election of God, not to erre pretending piety.</p>
               <p>And the third, that then a man erres preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding piety, when he doth a thing, wherewith by himſelf alone he thinks to ſatisfie God, and to oblige God. As if I ſhould chaſtiſe my body, not with that intent, with which S. Paul ſaith he chaſtiſed his, that is, to hold it in ſervitude, and ſubjection to his ſpirit; but with intent
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:99333:157"/> to merit by that chaſtiſement, which I do on my ſelf. Amplifying this compariſon throughout all the outward things which men do, it it eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily underſtood, when they erre pretending pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And I return to ſay, that he who ſhall feel himſelf directed by that way, through which he doth not erre pretending piety, he may certifie himſelf, that he is the ſonne of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently brother of the onely begotten ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>What Gods intent is, demanding of men that which of themſelves alone they cannot give him: And why he gives them not at once all that which he will give them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>UNderſtanding that it is true in effect, that men who ſee with the eyes of humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, hold it for injuſtice and cruelty in God <hi>that he demands of men things which they of themſelves alone cannot give him,</hi> ſuch as are, <hi>The love with all the heart,</hi> in the time of the law, and <hi>the Faith of the heart,</hi> in the time of the Goſpel; which are two things which a man is of himſelf as able to give unto God, as he is able to touch heaven with his hand. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding likewiſe as it is in effect true, that the men who ſee with the eyes of the holy ſpirit, do in and through the ſame, demand, know mercy, and piety in God; and they ſhould have known altogether the contrary in him, if
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:99333:158"/> ſo be he ſhould demand things that men could give unto him with eaſe. And conſidering whence theſe two ſo contrary judgements pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, which humane wiſdome and Gods holy Spirit make concerning this demand of God; I underſtand that the judgement which humane wiſdome makes, proceeds from the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the being of God, and the not knowing the being of man; and that the judgement which the holy Spirit makes, proceeds from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods being, and the being of man. And it is certain, that becauſe humane wiſdome knows not the being of God, it comes to paſſe that ſeeing he demands of men that which they cannot give, it judgeth that he doth this to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, as it would of one of the Princes of this world, who ſhould require of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that they ſhould not ſleep for a whole yeare, ſetting a penalty if they did ſleep. And becauſe humane wiſdome knows not the being of a man, it comes to paſſe that it would hold it for a better and more profitable thing for a man, that God ſhould require of him that which he can give, rather then that which he cannot give; even as it holds for better, that a Prince of the world ſhould demand of his vaſſals rather that which they can give him with eaſe, then that which they cannot give him, though with difficulty. And it is alſo true, that from the knowledge which the Spirit of God hath of
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:99333:158"/> Gods being, it comes to paſſe that not judging of him as of one of the Princes of the world, it knows, that he demanding of men that which they cannot give him, he doth it not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, but to ſave them: and that from the knowledge which the holy Spirit hath of the being of man, it proceeds, that knowing that man in himſelf is ſo arrogant, that if God ſhould demand of him for his ſalvation things that he could eaſily give of himſelf, he would enter into ſuch pride when he had given them, that by the ſelf ſame way whereby he thought to obtain ſalvation, he would get condemnation; by this he comes to know, that the intent with which God demands of men that which of themſelves they cannot give him, is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, as humane wiſdome judgeth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it to hinder their ſalvation, as humane wiſdome judgeth, which hereupon holds God for unjuſt, and for cruell: but it is to ſave them, and to further their ſalvation: God doing this to the intent that men aſſaying and trying to <hi>love God with all their heart,</hi> and to believe in him; and finding themſelves altogether unable thus to love and believe, they ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto God, and beg thoſe graces of him, and by thoſe gifts and graces of his, they may obtain that felicity which they deſire, not for that which they are of themſelves, but for that which they are through God. In ſuch manner,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:99333:159"/> that with much reaſon, not humane, but divine, men that ſee with the holy Spirit, know mercie and piety in God, conſidering that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from men that which they cannot give him of themſelves, and they would know cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in God, when he ſhould demand of them that which they could give of themſelves. Even as a man that hath diſcretion, when he ſaw that a father ſhould put the government of his eſtate upon an ignorant and unwiſe ſonne of his, holding the father for wiſe, he would judge that he had not intent to make his ſonne the heir, but to cauſe him to looſe the eſtate: So much different is the judgement which the Spirit of God makes in the judgement of God, from that which humane wiſdome knows in the ſame things. And here I underſtand, that for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for which God demands of men that which they cannot of themſelves give him, it comes to paſſe that to them to whom he begins to give love, and faith, and increaſe and growth in them, through ſome acknowledgements and feelings, and ſome taſts of ſpirituall and divine things, he doth not give ſo much evidence, and and ſo much clearneſſe in them, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would, and as much as might ſerve to make that they ſhould fully comprehend him with their underſtandings. I would ſay, that as he demands of them that which they cannot give him, to the intent they ſhould not grow
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99333:159"/> proud, as they would if he ſhould demand of them that which they could give him, and ſo their ſalvation would be hindred; ſo he doth not let them intirely comprehend ſpirituall things, which he ſometimes makes them feel, to the end they ſhould not pride themſelves, and ſo hinder their ſalvation. God knows our evil lump, and deſiring our ſalvation he deals with us, as he ſees it convenient we ſhould be dealt with: herein doing that with us, which we do with a child, when we would have him to love us, and depend on us. I would ſay, that as we give not the child at one time all that which he would have from us, and which we mean to give him; nay rather ſome things we give him altogether, others in part, and others we onely ſhew unto him, ſo much as to breed in him a deſire to them, and to enamour him of them, to the end he may go en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amouring himſelf of us, may follow, and depend on us; knowing that if we gave him at once all that which we have to give him, he would grow proud, and would not love us, nor depend on us: ſo God giveth not unto us at once all that which we would have from him, nor all that which he will give us, but ſome things he gives altogether, and others in part, and others he lets us ſee ſo much as ſufficeth to breed a longing in us for them, and to enamour us of them; to the intent we may follow him, love him, and depend on him. This he doth, becauſe he knows us to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99333:160"/> be ſuch, that if he ſhould give at once all that which he hath to give us, we ſhould become proud, and ſo he ſhould not have from us what he would, that is, that we ſhould <hi>love him with all our heart,</hi> and that for the obtaining of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, firmly believing we may make ours the juſtice of his onely begotten ſonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN Chriſt I conſider <hi>two weakneſſes:</hi> the one is that which he felt in the <hi>inward;</hi> and the other is that which he ſhewed in the <hi>outward.</hi> That which he felt in the inward, I conſider in <hi>the tears</hi> which he ſhed over <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and in thoſe which he ſhed in <hi>the death of Lazarus;</hi> and in <hi>the agony with which he prayed in the garden, ſweating drops of bloud.</hi> And that which he ſhewed in the outward, I conſider it ſeeing he was held <hi>for baſe, for vulgar, for vile,</hi> yea and alſo for <hi>an ill, a pernicious,</hi> and for <hi>a ſcandalous man,</hi> and ſeeing that he was <hi>mocked,</hi> injured, and perſecuted untill he was crucified for a malefectour, and as a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour. And I underſtand that without any compariſon the weakneſſe that Chriſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the outward, was greater then that which he felt in the inward. I would ſay, that the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99333:160"/> inward which he felt, was not in that degree of weakneſſe, which the outward was, that he ſhewed.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Chriſt I conſider <hi>two Powers,</hi> two virtues, and Efficacies. The one is that which he felt in the <hi>Inward,</hi> the other is that which he ſhewed in the <hi>Outward.</hi> The power which Chriſt ſhewed in the inward I conſider in this manner, that he ſaid to S. <hi>Peter</hi> when he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended him for cutting off <hi>Malchus</hi> his ear, <hi>Thinkeſt thou not that I can pray my Father, and he ſhall ſend me more then twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> And I conſider in many ſpeeches which I read in S. <hi>John,</hi> when Chriſt ſpake of his Union, which he had with God. And the power, which Chriſt had in the outward, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the <hi>miracles which he did,</hi> and in the <hi>authority, with whith he did them,</hi> and in the <hi>Power, and Majesty with which he ſpake, and taught.</hi> And I underſtand that without all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, the power, the virtue, and the efficacie that Chriſt felt in the inward, was greater then that which he ſhewed in the outward. I ſay, that the outward which he ſhewed, was not in that degree of power, as the inward was, which he felt.</p>
               <p>In every one of them, who are Chriſts mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, I conſider the ſame, as it were, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in Chriſt. I will put the example in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom after the ſame manner I conſider <hi>two
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99333:161"/> weakneſſes,</hi> one which he felt in the inward, and the other which he ſhewed in the outward, That which he felt in the inward is well known by that which he ſaith of <hi>ſinne, that dwelt in him. Rom.</hi> 7. and for that he ſaith, 2. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. <hi>I will gladly glory in my infirmities.</hi> and in that, <hi>when I am weak, then am I ſtrong.</hi> For I underſtand it was ſaid unto him on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my grace is perfected in weakneſſe.</hi> And that which he ſhewed in the outward, was well ſhewen by the evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> opinion that almoſt every one had of him; every one perſecuted him, every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled him, evil intreated him, martyrized him, as is read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and as he himſelf writes, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. And I underſtand, that the weakneſſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhewed in the outward, was much greater, then that which he felt in the inward. I ſay, that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> felt in the inward, was not in that degree of weakneſſe, as that which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the outward. In the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two powers, two virtues, and efficacies; the one which he felt in the inward, and the other which he ſhewed in the outward. That which he felt in the inward he publiſhed, ſaying, <hi>I can do all things in him who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth me.</hi> And he ſhewed it very openly <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſaying, that there <hi>was no creature able to ſeparate him from the love of God.</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:99333:161"/> And that which he ſhewed in the outward, is ſeen by the miracles which he did, and by the many people that he converted. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the power which Saint Paul felt in the inward, was much greater then that which he ſhewed in the outward. I ſay, that which Saint Paul ſhewed in the outward, was not in that degree of power, as that which he felt in the inward,</p>
               <p>The ſame which I conſider in S. Paul I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in every one of them which are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, more or leſſe, according as is that part of faith and of the ſpirit, which every one of them poſſeſſeth, underſtanding that from Saint Pauls being a member of Chriſt, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that he was in all that hath been ſpoken like unto Chriſt. Further I underſtand, that the conſideration of the two weakneſſes conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in Chriſt, works the ſame effect in him that conſiders them, that the weakneſſe which he feels in the inward, goes abating in him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as his affections and appetites go on dying; and the weakneſſe which he ſhews in the outward, goes increaſing, inaſmuch as he is eſteemed more vulgar, more vile, and of leſſe regard, and more mocked, injured, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and worſe intreated. And I underſtand alſo, that the conſideration of theſe two po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, virtues, and efficacies conſidered in Chriſt, works that effect in him that conſiders them,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99333:162"/> that in him grows increaſing the power, virtue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and efficacy that he feels in the inward, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he hath more conſcience, hath more ſpirit, and more other knowledges, and divine conceptions of God, and of the things of God. And there goes abating in him the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, virtue, and efficacy which he ſhews in the outward, inaſmuch as he onely ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when he is inſpired and moved of God to ſhew himſelf; ſo as that ſo much is one the more like to Chriſt, inaſmuch as he is more weak in that which is ſeen, and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in that which is not ſeen.</p>
               <p>I will adde this, that the Saints of the world know the power in God by the power that Chriſt ſhewed in the outward, knowing weakneſſe in God through the weakneſſe that Chriſt ſhewed in the outward.

               <p>HAving oft-times heard ſpeak of the <hi>agony,</hi> of the <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>loathing,</hi> and <hi>ſorrowfulneſſe, which Jeſus Chriſt our Lord felt at his paſſion and death,</hi> by perſons who pretended to ſhew the cauſe why Chriſt felt ſo much his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and his death; many other men having ſuffered and died, ſome as men, and ſome as Chriſtians, ſome of them without having ſhewed ſo much ſenſe, others having ſhewed none at all, and others having made ſhew to rejoyce, and delight themſelves in their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to rejoyce in their death. And never having remained ſatisfied, neither with that which I heard ſay, nor with that which I reade in their books which handle this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Laſt of all joyning that which I heard a Preacher ſay with that which is read in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> chap. 53.5. and in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:99333:163"/> have made this reſolution, That God having put all our ſinnes on Chriſt to puniſh them all in him, and he having taken them all upon himſelf, and known them all in generall, and in particular, he felt for every one of them that confuſion, that ſhame, and that grief, which he ſhould have felt, if he himſelf had committed them. Whereupon ſeeing himſelf in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God polluted and defiled with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and ſo abominable ſinnes, it came to paſſe that he felt all that <hi>agony,</hi> all that <hi>fear,</hi> all that <hi>ſorrowfulneſſe</hi> within himſelf, and all that ſhame and confuſion, which appertained to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us to have felt for every one of our ſinnes, had we been puniſhed for them. Whence proceeded, that he <hi>ſweat drops of blood in the garden,</hi> for the anguiſh which he felt, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaw himſelf near unto death, but to ſee himſelf in the preſence of God full of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes, for which reaſon <hi>he prayed putting his face to the earth,</hi> as if he had been aſhamed to have looked up to heaven, knowing that there lay upon him ſo many offences committed againſt God. And this truly is the cauſe why Chriſt ſhewed more ſenſe of grief in his <hi>paſſion,</hi> and in <hi>his death,</hi> then any of the Martyrs, that have ſuffered for the Goſpel, and then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man of the world that hath dyed for the world. And of this ſhame, and confuſion, which Chriſt felt ſeeing himſelf defiled with our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:99333:163"/> ſinnes, he may have felt ſome little parcell, that hath ſeen himſelf in the preſence of ſome great Prince, praying him for the pardon of one that hath been a traitour, he feeling the ſhame that belonged to the other to have felt. Now that it is true, that God hath laid on Chriſt all our ſinnes, and that Chriſt hath taken them all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, is plain by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 53. where he ſayes, <hi>He took our infirmities, and our griefs he ſuffered:</hi> and a little after, <hi>he was ſcourged for our rebellions, and beaten for our iniquities:</hi> and a little after, <hi>he took on him the ſinnes of many:</hi> and more then this he ſaith, <hi>we were healed by his blewneſſe of ſtripes.</hi> And this is proved by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. who feeling the ſelf ſame which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> felt, ſaith as it were the ſelf ſame which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth, <hi>And wretched man that I am!</hi> for now am I well aware of the evil that I have done in offending God, not living according to the will of God, inaſmuch as with every one of my offences, and with every one of my ſinnes I have augmented the <hi>agony,</hi> the <hi>fear,</hi> and the <hi>ſorrowfulneſſe which my Lord Chriſt ſuffered in his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>

And the going into deſtruction, I underſtand ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in this, that none of us ſhould have been able to ſtand ſolid and firm in the ſuffering without fainting, and ſo to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For being to be puniſhed for the ſinnes of us all, knowing them, and feeling them all in himſelf, as if he had committed them all, he might make reſiſtance to the <hi>agony, fear,</hi> and <hi>ſorrowfulneſſe,</hi> to the ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, without coming to nothing, and without in any manner departing, no not in any part, from the obedience of God; perſevering and ſtanding therein ſolid, and conſtant, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſtood, who was likened to a Lamb that is lead to the ſlaughter as well for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency with which he lived, as for the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>IN the glorious <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord I conſider <hi>five things,</hi> which do in a great manner excite me to live in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, a life very like unto that, which I am to live in life everlaſting.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that as the torment, which Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elt in ſuffering, was in great manner increaſed, becauſe he took upon him our ſinnes, and knew them on himſelf, as well as if he had himſelf committed them all: ſo the glory, which Chriſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elt in his <hi>reſurrection</hi> was increaſed in great manner, to ſee that we all of us aroſe with him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that as God ſlaying on the croſſe the fleſh of Chriſt, ſlew ours, in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that to himward we are held, and judged as if we had been really, and indeed dead: ſo God raiſing up Chriſt raiſed us all up, in ſuch manner that as much as belongs to him we are held, and judged as if we had been really rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third,</hi> that as the effect whereby our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation in the death of Chriſt in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:99333:165"/> life is known by our mortification, not that which we make with our own induſtries, but that which we obtain by the incorporation in Chriſt, which the holy ſpirit works, which is by faith communicated unto us, making us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the world with all that which is world, and alſo our ſelves with all that which is ours: So likewiſe the effect by which our incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the <hi>reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt is known in this preſent life, is our vivification, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation in Chriſt the ſpirit works in us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating and renewing us all, and altogether; and making us to love God, and all that which is Gods, and to love Chriſt, and all that which is Chriſts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> thing which I conſider is, that as with my ſinnes I augmented the agony, and the torment of Chriſt in his paſſion; ſo with my <hi>reſurrection</hi> I augment the joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Chriſt in his <hi>reſurrection.</hi> And as I am grieved at that, ſo I glory in this. Nay, the glory of this makes me to forget the ſorrow of the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> thing which I conſider is, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they, who ſtand incorporated in Chriſt are certain of their <hi>reſurrection,</hi> founding it in the <hi>reſurrection of Christ.</hi> And therefore S.

               <argument>
                  <p>That onely the incorporation in Christ is that which mortifies.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>REturning to conſider that which I have at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times conſidered about the two depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that are in a man, whereof the one is naturall and hereditary, the other acquiſite and learned; I come to underſtand, that both theſe depravations are in the mind, and in the body alſo. I ſay, that from our firſt parents all men inherit this, that they are born in their minds wicked, and enemies of God, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to God, and full of ſelf love; and in their bodies they are born vicious and evil inclined. And I ſay further, that with evil exerciſes, with evil companies, and with falſe doctrines, we go on augmenting as well the depravation of the ſoul, through which we are born the ſonnes of wrath, as that of the body, through which we are manifoldly worſe then beaſts.</p>
               <p>Humane wiſdome not knowing the naturall depravation of the mind, nor that of the body; nay, onely knowing the inbred depravation of the body, hath never had intent to mortifie in men but onely that which it hath known for evil. And hence it comes, that all the Laws, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and Religions, which men have found
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:99333:166"/> out, have had intent onely to mortifie the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the body, and of this onely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite. But God knowing principally the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall depravation, and of this holding that of the mind for the worſe, had in the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an intent to mortifie both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depravation, and principally that of the mind, which is more naturall and more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto men, being as it is more contrary unto God: And therefore commanded the love of God, the worſhip of God, and the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, and forbade all inward concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence. This which the Law of God preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do, it never did, not through the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof, but through the imperfection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> men. But the incorporation in Chriſt doth it foraſmuch as aſſoon as a man is incorporated by faith in Chriſt, the naturall, and inbred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations begin to die in him, and they go on dying accordingly as he goes <hi>incorporating himſelf in Christ.</hi> And a man goes <hi>incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating himſelf in Chriſt</hi> accordingly as he goes on being like unto the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the body, the <hi>mortification</hi> of the acquiſite depravation which remains, is facilitated, to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:99333:166"/> to the end that he ſhould, as it were by way of exerciſe, attend to mortifie it whilſt he lives. And he mortifies it rather with inward conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then with outward works. And his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is of that which Chriſt ſuffered, of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead on the Croſſe with Chriſt, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed with Chriſt, and that it is his intent to live in life eternall with Chriſt; which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations are of ſuch efficacy in a man, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him to looſe the taſte of all things of this preſent life, they mortifie in him all that is fleſh, and all that is world; albeit I do not think that it dies altogether, untill that a man die indeed. From all this is gathered, that humane wiſdome knows not what thing <hi>mortification</hi> is, and that the law of Moſes commanded it, but did not give it; and that it is onely gotten through the incorporation, wherewith we who believe are incorporated in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>To know the inward Motions when they are of the holy ſpirit, when of the malignant ſpirit, and when of a mans own ſpirit.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Remember I have formerly written in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, how men in this preſent life are moved to all things which they do with one of theſe three ſpirits; with the <hi>holy and divine ſpirit,</hi> with a <hi>mans own and evil ſpirit,</hi> with a <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and diabolicall ſpirit.</hi> And becauſe I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:99333:169"/> how much it imports them who attend unto Chriſtian perfection, to know with what ſpirit they are moved to work, or not to work; I come anew to conſider, that we who attend to Chriſtian perfection, do well know that to obtain that which we ſeek, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and eternall life, it becomes us to follow the <hi>motions of the holy ſpirit,</hi> and to flie thoſe of the <hi>malignant ſpirit,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with thoſe of our <hi>own ſpirit.</hi> Further I conſider, that it befalls many, that not knowing how to make difference between theſe <hi>Motions,</hi> thinking to follow the <hi>holy ſpirit</hi> they follow the <hi>malignant ſpirit,</hi> or go after their <hi>own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpirit.</hi> Their errour proceeding not becauſe they know not whither they ought to go, for they well know they ought to go towards eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life; nor becauſe they know not the way; for they know well, that the way is piety, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and holineſſe; but from their not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in what thing properly piety, juſtice, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe do conſiſt; for in caſe they knew it, they would draw nigh to know when they are <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the holy ſpirit,</hi> when by the <hi>malignant ſpirit,</hi> and when by their <hi>own proper ſpirit.</hi> For inaſmuch as a man goes on knowing in what thing properly piety, juſtice, and holineſſe do conſiſt, his eyes are dayly more opened to know when he is moved by one ſpirit &amp; when by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; without w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> knowledge a man that attends
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:99333:170"/> to Chriſtian perfection is much like unto a ſhip, which ſtands in the midſt of the ſea, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what wind to ſail, becauſe it hath loſt the needle. Having afterward conſidered how that all this is true, of which there is none that attends unto Chriſtian piety but can give teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie; I come likewiſe to conſider, that after that a man, who attends unto Chriſtian piety, knows that he travels towards life eternall, and knows that the way is piety, juſtice, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, it is neceſſary that he ſhould know, that holineſſe conſiſteth in the election of God; that is, that they onely are holy whom God chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and accepteth for himſelf; that juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in believing in Chriſt, that is, that they onely are juſt, who believing make Chriſts ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice theirs; and that piety conſiſts in appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for good all that which God works, and to be contented therewith; that is, onely they are pious, who with their minds approve that which God works; and in ſuch manner content themſelves, that they would not change, nor alter it, though they could. I underſtand, that this being known, a man begins in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to approach to know the <hi>motions of the ſpirit,</hi> when they are of the <hi>good ſpirit,</hi> and when they are of the <hi>evil ſpirit,</hi> and when they are of a <hi>mans own ſpirit.</hi> Forasmuch as he holds for <hi>motions of the good ſpirit</hi> all thoſe things, which go directed to anſwer unto the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99333:170"/> vocation of God, to ſay with S. <hi>Paul, Lord what wilt thou that I ſhould do?</hi> And with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias, Behold, Lord, here am I!</hi> and all they which go directed to believe in Chriſt, to ſay alwayes, <hi>Lord increaſe my faith!</hi> and all they which are directed to reſigne themſelves in all things, and altogether to God, to ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ruled and governed of God, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and holding for good all that which God doth. The ſame holds for <hi>motions of the evil ſpirit,</hi> all thoſe which are contrary to theſe. He holds for <hi>motions of his own ſpirit,</hi> thoſe which although they be not contrary to theſe, are not contrary to himſelf. By this I ſuppoſe every perſon, who ſhall keep ſtrict accompt with himſelf, ſhall approach near to the true knowledge of the ſpirits, to underſtand with which of them he is to walk. And I ſuppoſe that he ſhall better approach when he knows that thoſe are motions of the holy Spirit, which ſhall draw him to the imitation of Chriſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; inasmuch as he was moſt obedient to his eternall Father; inasmuch as in him was perfect charity: inasmuch as he had profound humility, and exceeding great meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For it is certain, that the holy ſpirit in them who are the members of Chriſt, being the ſame which was in Chriſt, doth inſpire and move them unto that, unto which it did inſpire and move Chriſt; him as head, and as the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99333:171"/> Son, us as members, and adopted ſonnes: And certifying himſelf likewiſe, that thoſe <hi>are motions of the malignant ſpirit,</hi> which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe; and that thoſe are <hi>motions of a mans own ſpirit,</hi> which do draw a man unto his proper intereſt, to his proper honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to his proper recreation and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And moreover I do not ſay hereby, that he doth aſſure himſelf in making this difference of ſpirits, and in knowing theſe motions; but I ſay, that ſo a man comes approching thereunto, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the perfect, and intire knowledge to them who have it by particular gifts of God, who know Satan even when <hi>he transforms himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and propounds unto them things of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent piety, juſtice, and holineſſe, to which time theſe adviſes do properly belong, it being a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great inconvenience, into which men fall, when they erre pretending piety.</p>
               <p>Finally, I reſolve my ſelf in this, that a man who deſires to make good proceedings in Gods wayes, attends to recouer in this preſent life the image of Chriſt, ſetting Chriſt before his eyes, and bringing himſelf to follow thoſe <hi>motions</hi> which Chriſt would have followed, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with thoſe motions which Chriſt would not have followed. And this is that perfection, which is propoſed to all of us that are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>REading S. Paul, I find he toucheth many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets worthy of much conſideration. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others I eſteemed it for moſt worthy that which he toucheth Rom. 8. concerning the <hi>reſtauration</hi> of the creatures in the glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the ſons of God: into the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which ſecret I have oft-times entred, and it hath befallen me, that by how much the more I would have underſtood it, ſo much the leſſe have I underſtood it; At length my ſpirit came to this underſtanding, that <hi>as man in his depravation marred all the creatures, ſo in the reparation of man all the creatures ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired:</hi> That the firſt Adam ſubjecting all men unto miſery and unto death, marred all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and that the ſecond Adam Jeſus Chriſt our Lord conducting men unto felicity and to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, ſhall repair all creatures. But as I did not underſtand in what ſort all <hi>the creatures were marred in mans depravation,</hi> ſo I did not underſtand <hi>in what ſort they ſhall be repaired in mans reparation.</hi> In w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> thing that ſecret which S. Paul means, doth conſiſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſecret it ſeems I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah had formerly underſtood, c. 65. where God promiſed to <hi>create new heavens and a new earth.</hi> And the ſame ſecret it ſeems Saint Peter
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99333:172"/> underſtood in the laſt Chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle; and the ſame ſeems to be underſtood in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> chap 21. Then I underſtand, that God having created man in a ſtate of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality and ſoveraigne happineſſe, he created all things which ſuch order, and with ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they did all of them accord to make man immortall, and moſt happy. Further I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that man ſubjecting himſelf to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by eating the fruit of the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil, and making himſelf lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to death in being diſobedient to God, eating the fruit of the tree againſt the commandment of God; it was neceſſary that all the creatures ſhould leave their being and their temper, with which they were created to make man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and moſt happy, and take another being, and another temper, whereby they ſhould all accord to make man miſerable and mortall, From hence proceeds the evil influences of the heavens, and the poyſonfull and unhealthfull things which the earth brings forth, all which augment mans miſery. And from this that all creatures took upon them to make man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and mortall; Saint Paul ſaith, that <hi>all of them do anxiouſly deſire to be free.</hi> Underſtanding this, I come to underſtand that men being to be immortall, and moſt happy in the reſurrection of the juſt, all the creatures ſhall return to recover that being, that temper,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99333:172"/> and that order with which they were created, to make men in their <hi>reparation</hi> immortall, and moſt happy, as in their <hi>depravation</hi> they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their being, their temper, and their order to make them miſerable, and mortall.</p>
               <p>In this generality of creatures I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the good Angels to be compriſed; for not being marred they have no neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repaired: nor the evil angels; for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been marred with man to make man mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and mortall, they ſhall not be reſtored with man to make him immortall, and moſt happy. In this conſideration more then in any other of theſe which I have hitherto conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, me thinks I ſee the moſt high obligation, which not onely all men in particular, but all the creatures in generall have to Chriſt. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as through Chriſts obedience men ſhall return to that being of immortality, and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which they loſt by Adams diſobedience. And by the ſame, the creatures ſhall return to recover their being, and their moſt perfect tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which they loſt through the diſobedience of Adam. And ſo this remains imprinted in my mind, that Adam diſobeying God, depraved all men, and condemned them unto death, and marred all the creatures: and ſubjected them, as Saint Paul ſaith, to <hi>vanity;</hi> And that Chriſt obeying God, repaired all men, and gave unto them immortality, and reſtored all the creatures,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:99333:173"/> and put them into their firm, and ſtable being. I ſpeak of this that ſhall be in the Reſurrection of the juſt, as though it were already; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to Godward it is already, Chriſt being already raiſed up. And by how much the more I remember this, ſo much the more do I abhorre all manner of diſobedience to God, and ſo much the more do embrace my ſelf with all manner of obedience to God. And I feel, that inaſmuch as I go applying my ſelf to this, ſo much the image of Adam goes abating in me, and the image of Chriſt goes on reforming, and likewiſe that of God, to whom be glory everlaſting <hi>Amen.</hi>

Furthermore I underſtand, that as the child coming nigh the knife, and cutting himſelf falls into the inconvenience of which his mother had given him warning, and his mother beats him for his diſobedience according as ſhe had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him; ſo that the child falls into two incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, the one is, of having cut himſelf with the knife, and the other is of blows for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience towards his mother: So the firſt man <hi>eating of the Tree of the knowledge of good and

Whence I come to gather, that God ſhewed moſt exceeding great love to man, in commanding him that he ſhould not eat of the fruit of that Tree: for I underſtand that he commanded him, becauſe he ſhould not fall into the inconvenience in which he fell upon the knowing of good and evill; Which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is much greater then we can imagine. This is according to what S. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 5. ſaith, that <hi>ſinne entred by diſobedience, and death entred by ſinne, which was executed on all the deſcendents of the first Adam: For in his diſobedience they all diſobeyed, and ſo all ſinned<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That God having determined to deceive humane wiſdome in ſaving not them that were <hi>wiſe,</hi> but them that <hi>believed,</hi> as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands it, 1. Cor. 1. it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould take upon him in the world a form of living, in which he could by no means be known by humane wiſdome. If Chriſt had taken on him S. <hi>John Baptists</hi> form of life, humane wiſdome would have found in that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward auſterity, whereon to found it ſelf ſo as to accept him for the ſonne of God: And if he had taken upon him <hi>Moſes</hi> his form of life, humane wiſdome would have found in that outward greatneſſe whereon to found it ſelf ſo as to accept him for the ſonne of God. And therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould take upon him that form of life which he took, wherein was no appearance at all of auſterity, or of greatneſſe. And ſo, it comes to paſſe, that by how much the more humane wiſdome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders it, ſo much leſſe doth it find whereon to found it ſelf ſo as to come to accept Chriſt for the ſonne of God. And hereto ſquares fitly a letter which I remember to have written, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſhew the cauſe wherefore Chriſt did ſometimes ſhew his divinty, and at other times hid it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That the life of Chriſt being to be an example of life to them whom he came to make the ſons of God, it was neceſſary that he ſhould
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:99333:176"/> take that form of life which was moſt imitable of all the reſt. If Chriſt had taken the form of Saint John Baptiſts life, he would have frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many with the auſterity of it; And if he had taken that of Moſes, few could have been able to imitate it; and therefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that he ſhould take that which he did take, ſo imitable to all ſorts of people, that no man can excuſe himſelf, ſaying, I cannot imitate Chriſt, I cannot live as Chriſt lived. Yet I do not underſtand, that Chriſt taking that form of life which he took did intend that every one who was to be the Sonne of God, ſhould imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in that outward form of living, but that it ſhould be the moſt eaſie to imitate by them, who would altogether imitate him as well in his outward, as in his inward living: as for the inward, in his obedience to God, in charity, meekneſſe, and humility of mind; and as for the outward, in living without auſterity, without greatneſſe, but with poverty, baſeneſſe and vileneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That Chriſt coming to ſave all ſorts of people, it was neceſſary he ſhould take ſuch a form of life, in which he might practiſe and converſe with all ſorts of people. If Chriſt had taken Saint John Baptiſts form of life the Publicans, ſinners, and harlots would have been aſhamed to ſpeak unto him; nay verily if he would obſerve decorum, he was bound

And therefore it was neceſſary he ſhould take that form of life, which he took, wherein he might practiſe and converſe, as he did with all ſorts of people, inſomuch as he was for this reproched by them, who made profeſſion of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and called a friend of Publicans and ſinners.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Chriſt coming to preach the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and to put himſelf in the poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion thereof; and the <hi>kingdome of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,</hi> as S.

If Chriſt had taken S. John Baptiſts form of life, which was by the world approved for holy; (for the world is ſo wiſe that it eſteems them, who eſteem not it,) he ſhould have put his imitatours in competition with the Saints of the world; and if Chriſt had taken Moſes his form of living, which is procured by the men of the world, he ſhould have put his imitatours in competition with the men of the world: and therefore that form of life which he took was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:99333:177"/> neceſſary, which is of ſuch quality, as they who imitate him do well preſerve themſelves in their righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy.

That Chriſt being to ſuffer for our ſins a cruell death, ſhamefull, and publick, and unjuſt, not voluntary, it was neceſſary he ſhould take a form of life that was fit to come to this effect. If Chriſt had taken Saint John Baptiſts form of life, although the fame of holineſſe would not have freed him from a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell death, as it did not free Saint John Baptiſt; yet it would have freed him from a ſhamefull and publick death, as it did free Saint John Baptiſt. And if Chriſt had taken Moſes his form of life, albeit the greatneſſe of the eſtate would not have freed him from a cruell death, as it hath not freed many great men of the world; yet it would have freed him from a ſhamefull and publick death: and therefore it was neceſſary<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> which things preſuppoſe mortification, it was neceſſary that he ſhould take a form of life very commodate to mortification, to ſhew with it, and by it the proper way of mortification. If Chriſt had taken Saint John Baptiſts form of life, he ſhould have well ſhewen the way of the mortification of the body by the aſperity of life, but not that of the mortification of the mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the honour and reputation which this form of life hath in the world. And if Chriſt had taken Moſes his form of living, he ſhould not have ſhewed either the one or the other kind of mortification, and therefore it was neceſſary, that he ſhould take that form of life which he took, in which much better then in any other, a man gets the mortification of the mind, and by that of the mind that of the body; inaſmuch as the world holds for vile and baſe, thoſe who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making profeſſion of outward holineſſe live holily, and deſpiſe them altogether; inaſmuch as after this deſpiſing comes the mortification of the body. And ſo in them that imitate the form of <hi>Chriſts</hi> living, is certain &amp; perfect mortification.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>ſix cauſes</hi> I learn <hi>ſix things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he who by conſideration of Chriſts life, would know him to be the ſonne of God, muſt of neceſſity mortifie the judgement of his humane wiſdome.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no man can excuſe himſelf, ſaying,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99333:178"/> that he cannot imitate the form of Chriſts living.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That then a Chriſtians form of life is moſt like to Chriſts, when it is apt to make all ſorts of people practiſe and converſe with him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That that form of living is moſt apt to make that a man in it ſhould preſerve himſelf in the poſſeſſion of the kingdome of God, that comes in competition with no ſort of men, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Saints of the world, nor with the men of the world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That that form of life is moſt like to that of the ſonne of God, that is moſt expoſed to martyrdome.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That that form of life is moſt proper, and able to obtain Chriſtian mortification, which is moſt deſpiſed in the eyes of the world, in which without making profeſſion of outward holineſſe, a man lives holily. And of the things which have been ſpoken, I take this reſolution, that they who live holily, without making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of outward holineſſe, are very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and expoſed to martyrdome, do preſerve themſelves very well in the kingdome of God, are fit to converſe with all ſorts of people, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the form of life in which Chriſt held, and deceive humane wiſdome: and therefore that properly appertains to them which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:99333:178"/>
               <p>I will adde this, that Chriſt continuing in that form of life in which he was born, being born the ſonne of God, untill that he dyed by the will of God; teacheth us, that we ſhall do well to continue in that form of life, in which we found our ſelves when we were called to be the ſonnes of God. So that in it we attend to reduce our form of life as much as may be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us, to be anſwerable to that form of life which Chriſt held in this world, in ſuch manner as in us may ſhine out intirely the image and ſimilitude of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>I Have oft times ſaid, that <hi>Chriſtian perfection</hi> conſiſts in this, that a man incorporated in Chriſt, in his death and in his reſurrection, ſhould live according to the Chriſtian <hi>Duty,</hi> keeping the <hi>Chriſtian decorum;</hi> underſtanding that ſo much ſhall a man get <hi>Chriſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> inaſmuch as he ſhall live according to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty,</hi> keeping <hi>chriſtian decorum.</hi> Now I ſay that then a man lives according to <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty,</hi> and keeps <hi>chriſtian decorum,</hi> when he imploys himſelf in thoſe things, in which Chriſt would have imployed himſelf. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently I ſay, that then a man departs from the <hi>christian duty,</hi> and leaves to obſerve <hi>chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99333:179"/> decorum,</hi> when he imployes himſelf in thoſe things, wherein Chriſt would not have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf: in ſuch manner, as to him who would obtain Chriſtian perfection, and is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to apprehend that dignity in which he is comprehended, it appertains to live in all things and altogether according to the Chriſtian duty, and to obſerve the Chriſtian decorum; ſetting before his eyes the whole life of Chriſt, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his duty and his decorum, in being in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing and altogether like, unto Chriſt, doing only that which Chriſt would do, and by no means doing what Chriſt would not do.</p>
               <p>Paſſing on further I ſay, that men whilſt they are, as the Scripture terms them, fleſh and bloud can by no means attain to ſo great perfection as that which is known in Chriſt. So alſo, that to all them, who know and feel themſelves incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, it appertains to fix their eyes upon this ſo high perfection, and to intend to obtain it, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to procure it. For to this I underſtand the holy ſpirit moves, and conducts them, to whom Chriſt is communicated. Here I gain two things, the one, that from henceforth I ſhall attribute to weakneſſe of my fleſh, all that which I ſhall do, which Chriſt would not have done; and all that which I leave undone, which Chriſt would not have left undone: And I will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:99333:179"/> unto the force and efficacy of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit, all that which I ſhall do, which Chriſt would have done; and all that which I ſhall leave undone, which Chriſt would have left undone, not excuſing my ſelf in that which ſhall proceed from mine infirmity, and weakneſſe, nor waxing proud for that which ſhall proceed from the force and efficacy of the Chriſtian ſpirit. The other thing which I gain is, that from this day forward I ſhall not go examining what is lawfull; holding that to be a matter of ſervants and ſlaves: But I will go viewing, and reviewing what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; holding that to be for ſonnes. And I will hold it for a thing convenient and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for me to live according to <hi>Chriſtian duty,</hi> and to obſerve <hi>Chriſtian decorum,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding this duty, and this decorum, as it were to ſay in the face of Chriſt, in all that which is written of him, and in all that which by the things which are written, and by that which I ſhall experiment in me, I ſhall be able to gather from his divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In theſe two things I underſtand other two: the one, that they do not know the Chriſtian dignity, who go procuring to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with pretence of Chriſtian piety, thoſe things which they do through weakneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the fleſh: and the other, that they do not know themſelves for ſons of God, who go
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99333:180"/> examining what is <hi>lawfull:</hi> (This being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they who know the chriſtian dignity, do with good will manifeſt, and confeſſe that which is of the weakneſſe, and infirmity of their fleſh, and that they who know themſelves for ſonnes of God, being aſhamed to examine what is <hi>lawfull,</hi> go obſerving what is <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> attributing to their proper infirmity, and weakneſſe all that which they do, and all that which they leave to do.) Attending to what is <hi>Lawfull,</hi> and going out of what is <hi>expedient;</hi> out of which they, who know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſonnes of God, and know the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an dignity, doe never procure to goe.</p>
               <p>The weakneſſe, and infirmity I underſtand we have it all of us in the body, and in the mind. To the weakneſſe and infirmity of the body I underſtand appertain all thoſe things in which we doe delicately, and with corporall delight, ſerve unto our corporall neceſſities. And to the infirmities, and weakneſſes of the mind, I underſtand appertain all thoſe things, in which we have intent to ſatisfie the eyes of the world; in ſuch ſort as I travelling on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back doe delicately ſerve unto the neceſſities of my body, a thing which Chriſt did not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: And this is a weakneſſe and infirmity of my body. And procuring that my riding on horſe-back ſhould be polite, and well furniſhed, I have intent to ſatisfie the eyes of the world:
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99333:180"/> and this is a weakneſſe, and infirmity of my mind. This example may be extended to all other things, which we deal about in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life. Whereupon it is fit to advertiſe, that they who begin to conform their lives in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and corporall things with that of Chriſt, runne hazard of never getting the conformity in the inward, which is the eſſentiall; and to fall into vain glory, and preſumption. And therefore it is needfull, that every perſon called of God to the grace of the Goſpel, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to conform himſelf to Chriſts living in the inward, that is, in obedience to God, in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and humility of mind, and in charity; and afterwards attend to conform himſelf alſo with the living of Chriſt in the outward; but ſo much onely, as the outward ſhall help him, and ſerve him to grow in the inward: For this is that, which principally pleaſeth God, and Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <p>BY one of theſe three wayes we come unto all things, as well thoſe which pertain to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as unto all other things: by our own wills; againſt our own wills; and by the favour of God. In thoſe things unto which we come by our own will, there is deſigne; in thoſe things whereunto we come againſt our wills, there is
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:99333:181"/> paſſion; in thoſe things, whereunto we come by the favour of God, there is admiration. The ſonnes of Adam never find <hi>certain and firm ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> in thoſe things, unto which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding piety, they come with deſigne. For their deſignes are alwayes founded in ſelf-intereſt, &amp; in ſelf-love. And holding this foundation when their deſignes ſucceeded not, they cannot ſtand with <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> how much ſoever they perſwade themſelves to remain ſatisfied, and would ſhew it to others. That this is true, they know by experience, who with deſigne pretend piety, changing their manner of living, their ſtate and condition of life, or do exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more in on thing, then in another. <hi>The ſonnes of God do then find certain and firm ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi> in thoſe things, unto which they come by their own proper will with deſigne, when their deſigne is either to help the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the vivification, into which they have begun to enter by the favour of God, or is to ſerve Chriſt in his members. That this is true they underſtand by experience, who hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves for dead in the croſſe of Chriſt, do attend unto mortification, with deſigne to mortifie themſelves onely to live as dead, in as much as they are dead, <hi>and their life is hid with Christ in God.

               <p>The ſonnes of Adam do ſeldom abide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion, and griefe in thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:99333:181"/> they come without their will, ſuch as are diſeaſes, infirmities, death and diſhonour: for they do not in theſe kind of things, know the will of God; or if they know it, they hold it for rigorous, and therefore judge themſelves enemies of God. That this is true all of us know by ſome experience. The ſonnes of God then are without paſſion, and griefe in thoſe things whereunto they come againſt their wills, when knowing the will of God, they reduce themſelves to conform themſelves with it; in which conformity they find content and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in their minds, albeit the fleſh feel grief, and affliction, being in that eſtate wherein it would not be. And it is no marvell, that in them who are ſuch, the fleſh ſhould reſent it ſelf and be grieved; ſince it did reſent it ſelf, and was grieved in the onely begotten ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
               <p>Tho ſonnes of Adam do ſeldome come to the things of piety, by the favour of God; and when they do come, they do not feel it, nor know it, and therefore do not taſte it, and not taſting it, they cannot therein find ſatisfaction. That this is true, they know by experience, who having been the ſonnes of Adam, are now the ſonnes of God, who do remember themſelves of ſome things unto which they came by the favour of God, they not knowing the favour of God in them, and therefore not taſting it,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:99333:182"/> nor finding content in them. The ſonnes of God come many times by the favour of God to the things of piety; and when they feel it, and know it, then they taſte it, and taſting it, they find ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction therein, and they remain with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. That this is true, the ſonnes of God themſelves know by experience, coming to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things without their own will, and without deſigne, without contradiction, and without paſſion, but properly through the admirable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; in ſuch ſort as they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have a deteſtation of thoſe things which they formerly loved, and with love of thoſe things which they formerly hated; without knowing by what way, or by what means they are come unto it.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:99333:184"/> riſen with Chriſt, he feels, and finds himſelf inwardly much changed in his deſignes, and purpoſes; in ſuch manner that he hates that which he loved before, and loves that which he hated before: I am of this opinion, that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and the hatred of the world, and of himſelf. <hi>is the proper ſigne, whereby a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knows himſelf to be the ſonne of God,</hi> and therefore the heir of eternall life. But I do not underſtand, that this mortification, nor this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred are at an inſtant, or at one throw perfect and entire in the mind, and in the body of a man, who becomes the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Goſpel, and by incorporation in Chriſt: Nor that they are perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, no not in the mind: But I underſtand, that the incorporation in Chriſt works this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in a man who accepts the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. For as before he accepted it, he delighted himſelf, and rejoyced with his mind, and with his body, in the honours, and in the dignities of the world, ſeeking them and procuring them, and keeping his intent principally on them, neither taſting, nor rejoycing in the principall and divine things, nor having any intent unto them, and therefore neither ſeeking, nor procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them; ſo after that he hath accepted it, he hates in his mind that which he formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and ſought, and loves that which before he deſpiſed and fled; changing altogether his intent.
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:99333:184"/> And albeit his body repugnes and contradicts, being not as yet altogether mortified, it ſufficeth that his mind ſtands changed as much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the intent conformable to his knowledge. That which I ſay of men and dignities of the world, I ſay alſo of the delights and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, underſtanding, that as the man that accepts the grace of the Goſpel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do accept it, is intent to ſeek and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his pleaſures and his contents, delighting his ſenſuality, and would if it were poſſible have as many other corporall ſenſes for to content, and ſatisfie himſelf ſenſually in the uſe of the creatures; and is grieved, and reſents himſelf, when any of his corporall ſenſes fail him, or are in any kind marred; ſo after he hath acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the grace, he doth not onely not attend to that which he formerly attended, but on the contrary he is altogether intent to deprive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all that which may give content and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his ſenſuality, and is grieved that he is neceſſitated to ſatisfie it in any thing, for the ſuſtentation of his life; and therefore would be content (if it ſo pleaſed God) to be deprived of his ſenſes, and rejoyceth when he finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deprived of any of them, or finds himſelf with any defect in any of them. All this I ſay in ſome degree a man begins to feel in himſelf ſuddenly after he accepts the grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, becoming the ſonne of God. And I ſay
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:99333:185"/> further, that as a man goes on growing in the incorporation in Chriſt, ſo he goes growing in his mortification, and in his hatred, in quality and in quantity; in quality, hating every day more that which he hath begun to hate, becauſe he knew it eſtranged from Chriſt, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a Chriſtian perſon incorporated in Chriſt; hating it likewiſe with his body aſwell as with his mind, outwardly and inwardly, as are the things which in themſelves are foule and unclean, (which things alſo men will hate, who with naturall light pretend to be juſt, and holy) and in quantity, hating much more thoſe things which he hath begun to hate. For he begins the ſpirituall light being more clear in him, to go on to know more diſtinctly the things which appertains to a Chriſtian man, and thoſe things which do not appertain to him, he goes on ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them more and more; firſt hating them with his mind, and reducing himſelf by little and little to hate them alſo with his body, and labouring that his hatred as well of the mind, as of the body, may go on increaſing in him. And this is properly the exerciſe of a Chriſtian man, for the whole time of his life.</p>
               <p>From all this diſcourſe this may well be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that <hi>the ſigne whereby I know that I am the ſon of God,</hi> and that I am dead on the croſſe with Chriſt, <hi>is not the totall mortification,</hi> nor the totall hatred of the world and of my ſelf,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:99333:185"/> with my mind and with my body in all things; <hi>but the beginning of this mortification,</hi> and of theſe hatings, and that in ſome principall things, eſpecially when it is come without being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured or ſought with humane induſtry; and when it continues in the mind, albeit the fleſh, and the ſenſuality will ſeek and procure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; yea and albeit in that which is offered to it, it rejoyceth, and delighteth it ſelf; the mind ſtanding free from that rejoycing, and from that delight, feeling diſpleaſure and trouble in thoſe things, of which it is forced through the frailty of the fleſh, to take more then is ſufficient to ſupply its corporall neceſſities; in ſuch manner as the body receives thoſe things, and not the mind, a man feeling together with the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his body, affliction of the mind. And in this, that is, for a man not to take more of the creatures then that which ſufficeth to ſerve to his corporall neceſſities, I underſtand conſiſteth that hatred, which Chriſt will, that they who would be his members, ſhould bear to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per life. And I underſtand that S. Paul ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this combate of his mind, would not that his body ſhould take more of the created things, then that which ſufficeth to maintain him alive; and his body would take more of them to ſatisfie and delight its ſenſuality: he felt that which he wrote to the Romanes, chap. 7. And ſince that went ſo with Saint Paul, which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:99333:186"/> hee himſelf in that place ſaith and confeſſeth, no Chriſtian is to eſteem himſelf an alien from Chriſt, nor from the Chriſtian Sonneſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feels a livelineſſe in his fleſh, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he feels not in every thing and altogether, the hatred of the world and of himſelf, which it behooves him to have, that he may be perfect; but feeling part of this mortification, and of theſe hatreds, as hath been ſaid, he hath good cauſe to hold himſelf for the <hi>Son of God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated in Chriſt, and dead on the Croſſe with Chriſt, and to attend in ſuch manner to mortification, that it may ſo much grow, that he may become like to Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who as S.

                  <p>That that ſuffering is moſt Chriſtian, and moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, in which he that ſuffers, finds leaſt of his own will.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL that we ſuffer in this preſent life, who attend unto Chriſtian perfection, whether in the body, or in the mind, is either by <hi>our own will,</hi> or by ſome others will. <hi>By our own will we ſuffer</hi> when we deprive our ſelves of our commodities, and ſatisfactions: And we <hi>ſuffer by others wills,</hi> when without our will we are deprived of our commodities, and ſatisfactions. Mans mind, as I have often ſaid is moſt arrogant, and being ſuch, it ſeeks in every
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:99333:186"/> thing its <hi>own glory,</hi> and its own honour: And therefore according as our humane mind ſtands alive in us more or leſſe, ſo we find more or leſſe ſatisfaction in that which we ſuffer. If the mind ſtand much alive, we find much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in that which we <hi>ſuffer by our own will,</hi> and little in that which we ſuffer by others will; And if the mind ſtand much mortified, we find little ſatisfaction in that which we ſuffer by our <hi>own wills,</hi> and much in that which we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by others will. And this much or little ſatisfaction, may give us teſtimony of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</p>
               <p>The perſon which hath his mind much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, alwayes feels and reſents himſelf in thoſe things which he ſuffers through others will, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well becauſe he doth not think that ſuffering thoſe things with patience, he pleaſeth God, it ſeeming to him, that it is becauſe he cannot chooſe; as alſo becauſe mans mind being moſt arrogant cannot ſuffer that violence ſhould be offered unto it. He who hath his mind much alive, doth alwayes rejoyce, and content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in thoſe things which he ſuffers by his <hi>own will,</hi> both becauſe in ſuffering he thinks to pleaſe God, as alſo becauſe where he knows his own will, he alwayes finds ſatisfaction. On the contrary, he who hath his mind much mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, alwayes eſteemes little, and hath ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which he ſuffers by his own will,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:99333:187"/> aſwell becauſe the principall thing, whereunto he hath intent, is to mortifie his own will, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes being ſuſpicious of it; as alſo becauſe being in the midſt of his own glory, he cannot well content himſelf with that ſuffering which is voluntary, knowing that it alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the glory and honour of him who ſuffers. And he who hath his mind much mortified, doth alwayes much eſteem &amp; content himſelf with that which he ſuffers by the <hi>will of God;</hi> aſwell becauſe he knowes that what he ſuffers, redounds, to the glory and honour of God, unto which thing he principally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; as alſo becauſe he therein mortifieth his own will.</p>
               <p>Amongſt thoſe things which a man <hi>ſuffers by his own will,</hi> being able not to ſuffer them if he would, I put Abſtinencies, Diſciplines, and Watchings, with all that which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto annexed: And amongſt thoſe things, which a man <hi>ſuffers by anothers will,</hi> I put Violences, Diſhonours, Perſecutions, Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Infirmities, Deaths, with all that which is thereunto annexed.</p>
               <p>They who have by experience known what thing a live mind is, and what thing a dead mind is, or at leaſt which is begun to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, examining themſelves by that which they ſhall have ſuffered, and ſhall ſuffer in both theſe manners, that is, by their own wills,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:99333:187"/> and by others will, ſhall know that all that which hath been written is true, their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge anſwering to experience, and knowing it they will attend to mortifie their minds from good to better, untill they have reduced them to thoſe terms, that in what they ſhall <hi>ſuffer by their own will,</hi> they intend to help and ſerve them who are the members of Chriſt, and to further their own mortification, which faith and the holy ſpirit work in them, as I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere ſaid: and that in that which they ſuffer by others will, knowing in all that the will of God, (and not that of men, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures which cauſe them to ſuffer) they rejoyce themſelves, and content themſelves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſatisfie unto the duty of piety, and to obſerve Chriſtian decorum. And I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that a man who <hi>ſuffers by others will,</hi> doth then attend unto the duty of Chriſtian pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, when coming into poverty by any occaſion whatſoever, he contents himſelf, therewith. The ſame I ſay of diſhonour, of corporall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and of death, with all other things which are of that quality. And then I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he who <hi>ſuffers by others will,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Chriſtian decorum, when ſuffering for Chriſt, he is contented to ſuffer, <hi>Glorying</hi> as S. Paul ſaith <hi>in afflictions!</hi> And for Chriſt I underſtand they ſuffer, who either for preaching the Goſpel, or for teaching Chriſtian living,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:99333:188"/> having the gift of an Apoſtle, or of a Doctour, are perſecuted, evil intreated, diſhonoured and martyrized; and they who for the Chriſtian life, in which a man attends to recover the image and likeneſſe of God by the imitation of Chriſt, are eſteemed baſe, murmured at, and ſlandered; and they who to accommodate, and ſatisfie them who are the members of Chriſt, and ſtand incorporate in Chriſt, deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their commodities, and ſatisfactions. And this voluntary ſuffering I hold to be moſt proper to a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>They who <hi>ſuffering by others will</hi> imitate <hi>Job,</hi> ſatisfie unto the duty of Piety, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves unto the will of God. And they who <hi>ſuffering by others will, and alſo by their own will,</hi> ſhall imitate S. <hi>Paul,</hi> obſerve the chriſtian decorum: God having ſhewed in <hi>Job</hi> a moſt efficacious example of patience in ſuffering by anothers will in naturall things, and in S. <hi>Paul</hi> a moſt divine example of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and patience in ſuffering by others will in Chriſtian matters.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I intend <hi>eight things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That according as my mind doth more or leſſe content it ſelf with that which it <hi>ſuffers by its own will,</hi> or by others will, I know that the mortification thereof is greater or leſſer,</p>
               <p n="2">II. That in that which <hi>I ſuffer by my own will,</hi> if I do not ſuffer it for Chriſt, I ſeek mine

               <p n="3">3. That contenting my ſelf with that which I <hi>ſuffer by others will,</hi> I do ſatisfie unto piety, and obſerve chriſtian decorum, and therefore ſeek the honour and glory of God.</p>

               <p>There are others, who attending unto the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew piety,</hi> which conſiſts in this, that a man ſhould in every thing, and altogether live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> whereunto he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, or perſwades himſelf to be obliged, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them according to the intention of him that made them; theſe go forming their <hi>conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> by that which they know of thoſe <hi>Laws,</hi> having a good, or evil opinion of themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they know their living conformable,

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:99333:191"/> that humane underſtanding is as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to comprehend the <hi>divine generation of the ſonne of God,</hi> becauſe this is a thing alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alienated from that which he knows, underſtands, and experiments touching his own <hi>generation,</hi> as the underſtanding of a worm, which is bred of the corruption of the earth, is uncapable of the generation of mankind, that is, how one man is the ſonne of another man, or one creature is bred of another; becauſe this is a thing moſt alienated from her own proper generation; beſides this, in caſe a worm ſhould come to underſtand in what manner a man is generated of another man, &amp; would make other worms to underſtand it, they would never be capable thereof, it being a thing altogether ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from their generation: ſo ſuppoſing that ſome one man ſhould come to underſtand the <hi>divine generation of the ſonne of God,</hi> and would make other men underſtand it, they would never be able to underſtand, becauſe it is a thing moſt different from their generation. And therefore extreme great is the raſhneſſe of men, who with their naturall light onely, will underſtand this <hi>divine myſtery;</hi> and alſo great is that of them, who will underſtand it being helped by the holy Scriptures and the language thereof, without the inward teaching of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit of God. And hence it comes, that albeit S. John underſtood the <hi>divine generation of the

This I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by that diſcourſe which S. John tels, chap. 3. that paſſed between Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and the great maſter of Iſrael called Nicodemus, <hi>who came to ſpeak with him by

Let this then be the concluſion, that it being true, that whileſt a man is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit, with all his naturall light, with all his ſciences, and humane learnings, and writings, he is not onely uncapable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>divine generation of the ſonne of God,</hi> but he is alſo uncapable to underſtand the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall generation of the adopted ſonnes of God.</hi> Let none be ſo bold without having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

The firſt following ſenſe, go after the judgement of ſenſuality. The ſecond following the naturall light, go after prudence and humane reaſon. And the third
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99333:193"/> following the ſpirituall light, go after Faith, Hope, and Charity. The firſt delight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that which pleaſeth ſenſuality. The ſecond deſpiſing that which pleaſeth ſenſuality, ſeek their own glory, and ſatisfaction of their minds. The third deſpiſing both the one and the other, love the honour of God, and the glory of Chriſt. The firſt the world loves. The ſecond the world deſpiſeth, albeit on the other ſide it prize and eſteem them. And the third the world deſpiſeth, hates and perſecutes. The firſt God knows not. The ſecond God abhorres. The third God prizeth, loves and favours. Where I do not underſtand, that God prizeth, loves and favours this third ſort, becauſe the world deſpiſeth them, abhorres and perſecutes them, but that the world deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, abhorres and perſecutes them, becauſe God priſeth them, loves and favours them.</p>
               <p>Further I underſtand, that from their thus feeling themſelves on one part prized, loved and favoured of God, and on the other part deſpiſed, perſecuted and hated of the world, it redounds, that they following where the holy ſpirit leads them, running after Faith, Hope, and Charity, eſteem themſelves <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> in this preſent life, eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Citizens of eternall life. Eſteeming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in this preſent life, they live like <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> having no intent to inherit in this
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99333:194"/> preſent life, nor to rejoyce in that which they rejoyce, who are Citizens thereof, and ſo they paſſe lightly through all theſe things, ſetting affection on none of them. And hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves Citizens of eternall life, they begin to live, as they live there, and they have intent to inherit in it, and to rejoyce in that which they rejoyce, who are Citizens thereof, and herein they ſet their affections. They I underſtand, that albeit the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of death frightens them in regard of the ſenſe, in regard of the livelineſſe that is in them, in their affections and appetites, yet in regard they eſteem themſelves <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in this preſent life, and Citizens of eternall life, it comforts them, and gives them content, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that death is the end of their <hi>Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> They who albeit they be indeed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, loved and favoured of God, are not yet deſpiſed, hated and perſecuted of the world, do not as yet eſteem themſelves <hi>Pilgrims</hi> in this preſent life, not being handled as <hi>Pilgrims;</hi> albeit they eſteem themſelves Citizens of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, inaſmuch as they know that they are prized, favoured and loved of God. It is true indeed, that this eſtimation is not entire, nor perfect in them, untill that the world know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them prized, loved and favoured of God, begins to handle them as <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> deſpiſing them, hating them and perſecuting them. For
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99333:194"/> as then they feeling themſelves handled by the world as <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> have recourſe to Chriſt, and recourſe to God: and being as they are more prized, more loved, more favoured of God, and more enlightned in the knowledge of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, they eſteem themſelves <hi>Pilgrims and ſtrangers</hi> in this preſent life, in ſuch manner that however afterwards the world return to prize, love and uſe them well, they do not leave to eſteem themſelves <hi>Pilgrims,</hi> and to hold it good to go out of this <hi>pilgrimage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I underſtand <hi>two things:</hi> The firſt, that it is Gods will, that they whom he loves ſhould live as <hi>Pilgrims.</hi> And the ſecond, that between them who hate the world, becauſe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted of the world for piety, and them who hate the world for other reſpects, there is this difference, that theſe ſecond although they bear hatred to the world, whileſt they are deſpiſed of it, and would be content to go out of it, yet when the world returns to prize them, they loving the world, would by no means go out of the world. And the other after that they once hate the world, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves deſpiſed, hated and perſecuted of the world, they never more return to love the world, how much ſoever it love, and eſteem them. This difference proceeds from hence, that following the light of the holy ſpirit, and being enlightned in the knowledge
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:99333:195"/> of eternall life, they do alwayes hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for <hi>pilgrims</hi> in this preſent life, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hold themſelves for Citizens of the Kingdome of God in eternall life, and therefore hate this life, and rejoyce to go out of it. On the contrary, the other following their naturall light have no certainty of eternall life; and if they have any, they are not ſure to be well in it, and therefore they do not altogether hate this life, nor rejoyce to go out of it. In this diſcourſe chriſtians ſhall underſtand, that they are to eſteem themſelves <hi>pilgrims and ſtrangers</hi> in the world in this preſent life, and that they are to eſteem themſelves Citizens of the Kingdome of God, in life eternall: And that if ſo be the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves very fearfull of death, ſhall make them know that they are not come to this to eſteem themſelves <hi>pilgrims,</hi> they ought with continuall prayer to ſeek it, being certain, that by how much more perfectly they ſhall ſtand therein, by ſo much the leſſe ſhall they be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of death, and they ſhall be moſt like to Chriſt and to God, who have been and are in this preſent life ſtrangers and <hi>pilgrims,</hi> and like ſuch have been, and are uſed. And to every Chriſtian it appertaines to procure to be like to God, and to the ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

                  <p>Whether Justification be a fruit of piety, or whether piety be a fruit of Juſtification.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WIlling to examine between theſe two gifts of God, <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Justification,</hi> which of them may be ſaid to be the <hi>fruit</hi> of the other, that is <hi>whether piety be the fruit of juſtification,</hi> a man being firſt juſt before pious, or <hi>whether juſtification be the fruit of Piety,</hi> a man being firſt pious before juſt; and willing in this matter to proceed with order, I firſt ſay, that by Piety I underſtand the true divine worſhip, which conſiſteth in <hi>worſhiping God in ſpirit, and in truth, John</hi> 4. approving with the mind what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God doth, holding it for juſt, holy and good. In this ſignification I underſtand S. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth this word <hi>Piety,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And I ſay, that by juſtification I underſtand that purity of conſcience which dares appear in judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, ſuch as was S. <hi>Pauls,</hi> when he ſaid <hi>there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Paſſing on further I underſtand, that calling into counſell for the making of this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination the naturall light, prudence and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, ſhe will alwayes ſay and affirm, that <hi>juſtification is a fruit of piety,</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that one cannot have juſtification, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in his conſcience, if he do not firſt <hi>worſhip God in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> giving unto him that which it ought to do as his creature:
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99333:196"/> and that ſuddenly when he gives to God that which he ought to give, he is juſt having purity in his conſcience. And ſo it is reſolved by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome, that Juſtification is a fruit of piety; ſince from a mans being pious it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds that he is juſt. Further I underſtand, that calling into counſell for the making of this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the holy ſpirit, and the Chriſtian ſpirit, he will ſay and affirm, that <hi>Piety is the fruit of Juſtification,</hi> underſtanding that a man cannot have Piety, <hi>worſhiping God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> if he be not firſt juſt, accepting the Goſpel of Chriſt and ſo making Chriſts juſtice his own, and underſtanding that inſtantly when a man believing is juſt, he begins to have Piety, <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God in ſpirit and truth.</hi> And ſo it is truly reſolved, that Piety is a fruit of Juſtification: for a man is firſt juſt, then pious. If that were true which naturall light, prudence and humane wiſdome ſaith, for the ſame cauſe it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that there hath not been, nor is, nor ſhall be a pious man, who ſhould give entirely, and compleatly unto God that which he ought to give. And it being true, that which the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Chriſtian ſpirit ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it well follows that there hath been, is, and ſhall be a great number of juſt men: for there hath been, are, and ſhall be many men, that have been are, and ſhall be juſtified by Chriſt, accepting, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Chriſts juſtice their own. Men that judge
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:99333:196"/> that <hi>Juſtification is a fruit of piety,</hi> by the ſame caſe give teſtimony of themſelves, that they judge by naturall light, by prudence and humane wiſdome, as <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> would have judged, who had no knowledge at all of Chriſt. And in very truth I know not what they think of Chriſt, of the Chriſtian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe. nor of the Goſpel. The men that judge that <hi>Piety is a fruit of Juſtification,</hi> by the ſame rule give teſtimony of themſelves, that they judge by the holy ſpirit and by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſpirit, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> judged, who largely knew Chriſt, and had the ſpirit of Chriſt. They have this opinion of Chriſt, that in him God puniſhed all our ſinnes, that is, all that wherein we fail of that which as the creatures God we are bound to give unto God. They think of Chriſtian buſineſſe, that it is a living under the government of the holy ſpirit in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and righteouſneſſe. And they think of the Goſpel, that it is a Proclamation that compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth theſe two things, Remiſſion of ſinnes, and Juſtification by Chriſt; And the regiment and government of the holy ſpirit: which two things they enioy, who believing in Chriſt accept the Goſpel. From all this I gather, that they who underſtand <hi>Justification to be a fruit of Piety,</hi> follow <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> And that they who underſtand <hi>Piety to be a fruit of juſtification.</hi> Juſtification being a fruit of Faith, follow S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:99333:197"/> and S. <hi>Peter.</hi> It is alſo gathered, that this name Piety underſtood in the manner in which it is here underſtood, cannot be attributed to God, becauſe he ows no man any thing. Nay on the contrary every one ows to him. And that which he doth with us, is not for piety, is not for debt, nor for obligation, but for compaſſion, for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and liberality, being in every thing towards us compaſſionate, mercifull and liberall; which ought principally to be known in this, that he put all our ſinnes on his pretious ſonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to put on us the juſtice of the ſame Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</p>

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:99333:200"/> their conſciences, the inward contradiction cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the <hi>difficulty</hi> of believing the Goſpel is taken away. They who believe being taught, as they never find peace in their conſciences, ſo they never believe the Goſpel: For the inward contradiction never ceaſeth, and that not cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, neither doth the <hi>difficulty in believing</hi> ceaſe; nay whileſt the contradiction laſteth, the <hi>difficulty</hi> may be called impoſſibility. Men do eaſily believe by relation of holy Scriptures, that God is moſt omnipotent, moſt juſt: They believe, that Chriſt is moſt innocent, and pure from all ſinne; They believe that Chriſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the will of God: for in none of theſe things they find inward contradiction which might hinder them from believing that which holy Scriptures affirm. And not to exclude the benefit of Chriſt, they believe alſo that Chriſt ſatisfied for originall ſinne, for neither in this do they find contradiction; inaſmuch as their conſciences not accuſing them of originall ſin, they not knowing their own fault therein, they eaſily bring themſelves to believe, that without their own merit that is pardoned unto them, wherein they know not their own fault. But when it comes to the point, to believe that Chriſt ſatisfied God for the ſins that every one of them commits, albeit they have the Scriptures which moſt largely give teſtimony thereof (nay they all in conformity preach this) yet ſuddenly they
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:99333:201"/> draw back, becauſe they find the inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in their own conſciences, and ſo they reſolve to reſtrain the benefit of Chriſt onely to originall ſinne; underſtanding it after their own manner, or to inlarge it alſo to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſinnes, but with the addition of proper ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. As if Chriſt had ſaid, I have ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſinnes of you all, but with condition, that every one ſhould ſatisfie for his own. And they conſider not the injury which herein they do to Chriſt, they conſider it not becauſe they feel it not, and they feel it not becauſe they know not Chriſt. They who by Gods gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God is moſt juſt, that Chriſt is moſt innocent, that it was the work of God that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſuffered for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall ſinne, in the end reduce themſelves to believe, that <hi>through Chriſts ſufferings they get remiſsion of ſins, and are juſt,</hi> and are now by the grace of God reconciled with God: conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in this manner, if God be moſt juſt, if Chriſt be moſt innocent, if that which Chriſt ſuffered, he ſuffered by the will of God, and the will of God was that he ſhould ſatisfie for ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin; it is alſo true, that men who have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole pardon of their ſins, are juſt, and are reconciled with God, ſince by originall ſin we all become ſinners, unjuſt, and enemies of God, and do things whereby we grow in inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and in enmity. With this conſideration they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99333:201"/> pacifie their conſciences, and further their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, and hold for certain, that they who do not believe this, either do not believe that God is moſt juſt, or do not hold that Chriſt is moſt innocent, or do not believe that it was Gods will that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer; for if they did believe this they would believe that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; that is, that he ſuffered not for himſelf, but for them, and ſo would hold themſelves for juſt. Here I underſtand all this, Firſt, the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of humane wiſdome, which is not capable of the truth which the Goſpel preacheth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ignorance of men, who not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whence this incapacity comes, do not attend to remedy but to cover it. Thirdly, that Chriſt ſatisfying for originall ſin, he ſatisfied for all that which we ſinne through evil incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is naturall unto us through origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne. Fourthly, that the faith of them who believe being taught, neither quieting, nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying their conſciences, doth not further them to believe that all our ſinnes are puniſhed in Chriſt. Fifthly, that the faith of them who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve inſpired, quieting and pacifying their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, helpeth them to believe, <hi>That all our ſinnes were puniſhed in Christ.</hi> And ſo it is, that they who have this inſpired faith, proving in themſelves the truth which the Goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, come to underſtand by experience that which at firſt they believed by inſpiration.

                  <p>That the fruits which in Chriſtians in the beginning of their Incorporation in Chriſt, ſeem to be of the ſpirit, are of the fleſh.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SEeing by experience, that almoſt in all perſons who accepting the Goſpel come to be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in Chriſt, in the <hi>beginning of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation,</hi> there are found certain taſts, feelings, deſires, vehemencies, and certain myſticall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of holy Scripture, of the Chriſtian buſineſſe, and certain tears, all <hi>which ſeem to be of the ſpirit, but are altogether of the Fleſh,</hi> and as matter of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> in time, dry up, and fall away. And willing to underſtand whence this proceeds, I have conſidered, that every one of them, who are <hi>incorporated</hi> in Chriſt, they are like unto a branch, which being cut from one tree is grafted into another. For as that branch would not produce the fruit which it
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99333:202"/> doth, if it were not grafted into that tree; though that firſt fruit be as it were altogether of the ſap which it brought with it from the tree from whence it was cut: ſo the perſon <hi>incorporated</hi> in Chriſt would not have the taſtes, feelings, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencies, deſires, or the underſtandings of Scripture, or the tears which he hath, if he were not <hi>incorporated</hi> in Chriſt; though theſe are as it were all <hi>Fleſh,</hi> affection of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie, and ſatisfaction of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> which ſtanding yet alive, and not able to ſatisfie nor pleaſe it ſelf in carnall matters, pleaſeth and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth it ſelf in ſpirituall matters. Whence I underſtand, that every one who comes to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated</hi> in Chriſt, may rejoyce in thoſe taſtes, feelings, deſires, vehemencies, underſtandings, and tears, inaſmuch as they aſſure him, that he is incorporated in Chriſt; for he ſhould not have any of theſe things, if he were not partaker of that incorporation. And I underſtand, that holding them for <hi>fruits of the fleſh and not of the ſpirit,</hi> by the ſap of that root of Adam, and not of that root of Chriſt, he ought to caſt them away, and to cut them off, no wayes reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, nor feeding himſelf with them. For that would befall him which befalls many perſons, who feeding themſelves with ſuch meat, perſwade themſelves that they <hi>live in the ſpirit,</hi> when they <hi>live in the fleſh.</hi> And I underſtand, that they ought to have intent, that there ſhould

                  <p>Whence it comes, that the wicked cannot believe; that the ſuperſtitious believe with eaſe; and that the godly believe with difficulty.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the wicked I conſider the <hi>impoſſibility in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;</hi> and I call them <hi>wicked,</hi> who make profeſſion to be the enemies of God, as <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,</hi> and as the Scribes and Phariſes, who were contrary unto Chriſt. In the <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>eaſineſſe in believing;</hi> and I call them <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> who not being godly, make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of piety, and believe that they are pious. And in the <hi>godly</hi> I conſider the <hi>difficulty in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;</hi> and I call them <hi>godly</hi> who having by the Spirit accepted the generall pardon, which
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:99333:203"/> the Goſpel offers unto them, attend to confirm themſelves in it, and to live in this preſent life, a life like unto that which they are to live in life eternall. The <hi>impoſſibility of the wicked</hi> I underſtand conſiſts in this, that God blinds their eyes, and ſhuts their ears, and hardens their hearts, to the end that not knowing the generall pardon, which is intimated unto them, they do not believe it, and ſo do not obtain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This S. <hi>John</hi> 12.39, 40. underſtood in this manner, when he ſaid, <hi>therefore they could not believe, becauſe Iſaiah ſaid again, he hath blinded their eyes.</hi> Nay this very thing Chriſt meant, as is proved by the three other Evangeliſts, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood it, as S. <hi>Luke</hi> teſtifieth the laſt of the <hi>Acts</hi> 25, 26, 27. The <hi>eaſineſſe wherewith the ſuperſtitious believe,</hi> I underſtand proceeds from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with humane wiſdome, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving by opinion, by relation, by uſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; they holding it for impiety to doubt. That this is true is proved by this, that amongſt thoſe true things which they believe, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many other falſe things, and they believe the falſe things, more then the true. Nay they do not believe that which is the foundation of all true things, that is, the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reconciliation with God by the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt. And I ſay they do not believe it; for if they did believe it, for the
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:99333:204"/> ſame reaſon they would leave to be ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and would be pious.</p>
               <p>The <hi>difficulty wherewith the godly believe,</hi> I underſtand proceeds from humane wiſdome, from evil conſcience, and from the livelineſſe of mind, and from the laſciviouſneſſe of the fleſh. It proceeds from humane wiſdome, for by how much they go on the more procuring to aſſure themſelves in the faith, ſo much the more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and impediment doth humane wiſdome make againſt them in it. That this is true, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this, that becauſe they principally procure to aſſure, and confirm themſelves, that all their ſinnes were puniſhed in Chriſt, in this they who are Chriſtians, find more difficultie, then in all other things which they believe. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from evil conſcience, inaſmuch as it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth a man as the enemy of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he with difficulty aſſures himſelf in that which the Goſpel proclaimeth, that God hath now pardoned him, and holds him for his friend. That this is true is proved by this, that inſtantly when a man finds peace in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he ſtands confirmed in the faith, in ſuch manner that he is little ſolicited to doubt. It proceeds from the livelineſſe of the mind, and from the laſciviouſneſſe of the fleſh, inaſmuch as mens mind being a friend to life, and his fleſh being a friend to rejoycing, doth eagerly combate againſt the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:99333:204"/> faith; underſtanding or gueſſing that faith ſlaies in a man the livelineſſe of the mind, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies the laſciviouſneſſe of the fleſh. That this is true is proved by this, that as the livelineſſe of the mind and the laſciviouſneſſe of the fleſh doth die in a man; ſo the believing goes on increaſing. But it is not to be underſtood that either death, or mortification of the mind or fleſh, are thoſe things which increaſe our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but faith being that which kills us, and mortifies us, the believing is increaſed in us, the forces being taken away from our enemies; I ſay from them, which make difficult to us our believing. In ſuch manner as humane prudence, and evil conſcience, and the livelineſſe of our minds with the laciviouſneſſe of our fleſh, are three Inſtruments whereby the evil ſpirits ſerve themſelves to make difficult our believing to us, who believe by Revelation, and by divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, Nay with theſe three Inſtruments I underſtand that the belief of the generall Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is hindred to the <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> who with eaſe believe all other things: and with the ſame I underſtand, believing is made impoſſible to the wicked, whom God hath made blind, deaf, dumbe; there being in all men, that is, in the <hi>impious,</hi> in the <hi>ſuperstitious,</hi> and in the godly ſelfe-love for the Principall enemy. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is true, that from it proceeds the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of humane prudence, and of an evil

That this is true, is proved by this, that if there were no ſelfe-love, a man would not be ſo curious in willing to aſſure himſelf of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an verity, he would not be ſo ſcrupulous in his conſcience, nor would ſo much oppoſe the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the mind, nor of the laſciviouſneſſe of the fleſh, and ſo the contradictions would ceaſe, and the contradictions ceaſing, the difficulty of believing would alſo ceaſe.</p>
               <p>From all this diſcourſe this reſolution may be taken, that if the <hi>wicked</hi> would be free from the <hi>impoſſibility in believing,</hi> they muſt attend to renounce their ſelfe-love, if they can: And that if the <hi>ſuperstitious</hi> would know that they are <hi>not pious, that they do not believe as they ought to believe,</hi> nor that which they ought to believe, they muſt attend to renounce their ſelfe-love as much as they can: And that the godly who ſhall feel themſelves moleſted with the <hi>difficulty of believing,</hi> and would take away the <hi>difficulty,</hi> and ſo make eaſie the believing, they muſt labour to diſenamour themſelves of themſelves, and of the world, and to enamour themſelves of God, and of Chriſt.

I ſay this conſideration will be very profitable to them, ſo that it alwayes go

               <p>
                  <hi>BElieving</hi> being the foundation of the Chriſtianity, which conſiſts in accepting the generall pardon by the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt, it ſeems neceſſary, that a Chriſtian ſhould exerciſe himſelf in thoſe conſiderations which appertain to believing. And ſo amongſt other things which I have conſidered about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, this is one, that <hi>a man never stands ſolid, and firm, and conſtant in the Chriſtian faith, untill he have in himſelf ſome experience of that which he believes.</hi> And it is certain, that he holds ſo much firmneſſe as he holds of <hi>experience</hi> in himſelf, and no more. It befalls us that believe the Goſpel which happens to us
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:99333:206"/> concerning a wiſe and ſpirituall man: that as whileſt we believe the wiſdome, and ſpiritualty of this man by relation of other men, we are ſo diſpoſed, that other men coming, who make to us a contrary relation, we change the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we had of him, or at leaſt we doubt of it, untill having ſtrict familiarity with ſuch a man, we know by experience that the relation is true which was made to us, for as then no man is able to perſwade us to the contrary: even ſo likewiſe whileſt we believe that which the Goſpell ſaith, that God puniſhed all our ſinnes in Chriſt, by their relation who preach the Goſpell to us, we ſtand in hazard, that other Preachers coming, which ſhould tell us the contrary, we ſhall believe in another manner, or at leaſt we ſhall doubt of the firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, untill that we by having <hi>experience</hi> of that which is preached unto us in the Goſpell, ſtand firm, and conſtant in that which we believe, all the men of the world being unable either to change, or alienate our faith in any manner, after that it is confirmed by our own <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> Whence I underſtand that the firſt and principall intent, which we ought to have, who accept the Goſpell, believing that in Chriſt God hath puniſhed all our ſinnes, is to get the <hi>experience</hi> of this, to the end that our faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo confirmed, no man may be able to ſever us from it, nor make us doubt thereof, or

The one, that he renounce all juſtifications that are without Chriſt, aſwell thoſe which conſiſt in not doing, as thoſe which conſiſt in doing; and that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing himſelf onely with the juſtification which is in Chriſt, which doth conſiſt in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, he addreſſe himſelf with prayer and ſupplication to God, that he would make him feel the peace of conſcience, that he would mortifie him, that he would make him alive, and the other, that he keep very ſtrict account with himſelf, of his works, words and

               <argument>
                  <p>Againſt the Imagination; with which our Chriſtian faith is troubled.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Now return to conſider that which I have oft-times ſaid, that for a man to be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to doubt, is a ſigne of Chriſtian profiting. For I underſtand that ſuch ſolicitation grows from a mans being willing to believe, and from his deſiring to ſtand firm and conſtant, in the Chriſtian faith of the generall pardon which is intimated unto men in the Goſpel. The wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are not ſolicited to doubt, becauſe they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will nor deſire to believe. Nor are the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ſolicited to doubt; for believing with humane and carnall wiſdome, they have none to ſolicit them to doubt. They who have made progreſſe in a Chriſtian life are little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to doubt; for having with much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirmed their faith, they have diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their enemies, I mean thoſe that did ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit them to doubt. And here I underſtand, that men are uncapable of being able to have ſo
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:99333:208"/> much faith in them, as that they ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together freed from being ſolicited to doubt, and therefore God gives them the faith accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their capacity, as we do not put ſo hot water into a veſſell of glaſſe, as into one of earth, nor ſo hot into one of earth as into one of braſſe, accommodating it unto the temper of the veſſell, not willing it ſhould be broken, ſo God doth in accommodating faith to the fitneſſe and capacity of the receiver, in ſuch ſort, as the much ſolicitation to doubt remains onely for them, who having left impiety, and being freed from the deceit of ſuperſtition, begin to accept by the holy ſpirit, the generall pardon which the Goſpel publiſheth, and begin to bring forth fruit in Chriſtian living, and go profiting in it. For they deſiring to believe find alive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves humane prudence, of which the evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſerve themſelves to ſolicit them to doubt. And ſo it is, that when one of theſe perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing, and leaving his own juſtifications; thoſe which conſiſt in doing, and thoſe which conſiſt in not doing, will comfort himſelf with the juſtice of Chriſt, which the Goſpel offers unto us, when through his own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he ſees it not ſo clear, and diſcovered, as he ſees corporall things, and thoſe which conſiſt in humane prudence, he is ſuddenly tempted, and ſolicited to doubt of the truth, which the Goſpel affirms; whereupon ſuch a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:99333:208"/> perſon ought ſuddenly to remedy the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſhall hold for a certain ſigne of his profiting in Chriſtian faith to be ſolicited to doubt, and he ſhall ſay, if I had not a will and deſire to believe, I ſhould not be ſolicited to doubt, as I was not ſolicited when I did not ſtand in this will, and in this deſire, and ſo he ſhall come to quiet himſelf with this matter, whereby the Divel procures to diſquiet him. And if there ſhall come a fancy to him to ſay that his doubting is of the ſame quality with that of them who doubt without the ſpirit, he ſhall ſay it is not true; for they who doubt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſpirit feel no diſtaſt in doubting, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be free, but I feel diſtaſte in doubting, and deſire to be free of it, and conſequently am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that my doubting is not of that quality with that of theirs who doubt without the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſhall think thus, if this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith were not a ſpirituall and divine thing, it would not find in me that contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which it finds, as thoſe things have not found contradiction in me, which were not ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall nor divine, but ſuperſtitious, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, in which I would perſwade my ſelf. And in this manner the contradiction, with which the divel would diſquiet him, ſhall be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to him to quiet him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſhall think this: If this Chriſtian
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:99333:209"/> faith were not the gift of God, I ſhould not feel in my ſelf thoſe new deſires to pleaſe God, to ſtand alwayes united with God, to ſee him glorified and ſanctified of all men, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires I have felt ſince I have in earneſt applyed my ſelf unto this faith. And in this manner with the experience of the love of God, he ſhall aſſure himſelf of the truth of that which the Goſpel affirms.</p>
               <p>Fourthly he ſhall think thus: If this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith were not a ſpirituall and divine thing, it would not have begun to give me an abhorring of corporall and humane things, and the things of the world, the which I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together abhorre, I am at leaſt come to this that I do not love them, procure them, deſire them, as I was wont. And in this manner by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of mortification, he ſhall confirm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the truth of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, he ſhall think thus: If I knew any other better thing then this, or at leaſt that were equall to this, with which I might appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement of God, I ſhould indeed have cauſe to doubt of the truth of this; now I knowing no other thing better, nor any other thing ſuch as it is, I have no cauſe to doubt. And thus he is come upon the gain, and not on the loſſe, &amp; that in perſevering in this Chriſtian faith he cannot looſe, but gain. And if it ſhall come into his fancie to ſay that he might looſe much
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:99333:209"/> in caſe that that which the Goſpel ſaith, were not true, inaſmuch as he ſhould attribute that to Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were not due to him, &amp; it not being due to him, he ſhould come to offend the glory &amp; the Majeſtie of God; he ſhall inſtantly have recourſe to experience and think thus; After that I know my ſelf pardoned through Chriſt, and reconciled with God through Chriſt, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging my ſelf dead with Chriſt, and raiſed up with Chriſt, and expecting my glorification with Chriſt; I know, and feel, and find in me the beginnings of mortification, deſpiſing the world and my ſelf; and I feel the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of vivification through the love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God, to the glory of God, &amp; to the will of God. And theſe principles are good. And it being true, that from an evil cauſe never comes a good effect, it is true alſo, that the cauſe is good, whence this effect is grown. And therefore it is moſt certain and true that which the Goſpel publiſheth and affirmeth: <hi>That God having put on Chriſt all our ſinnes, and having puniſhed them all in Chriſt, he hath pardoned us all, and hath reconciled us unto himſelf by Christ;</hi> which pardon and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation all they which believe enjoy. Hereby a Chriſtian ſhall ſtay himſelf, who (willing to comfort and ſecure himſelf with the juſtice of Chriſt) ſhall be diſturbed with the <hi>perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which ſhall ſolicit him to doubt, and
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:99333:210"/> ſhutting the doore to them which may come, ſhall recommend himſelf to God, ſaying with <hi>Hezechias, Lord I ſuffer violence, anſwer for me, Iſai.</hi> 38.

Albeit he did not truſt in the Ark, but in the word of God, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſave him in the Ark: and ſo not the Ark, but Faith was that which ſaved <hi>Noah,</hi> Heb. 11.7. with which he made the Ark, and put himſelf in it. In the ſame manner God could well ſave us in the day of judgment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the water of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and it ſeemes he takes the water for the meanes to condeſcend unto our frailty, which cauſeth that we do more eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be ſaved by <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> then we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be ſaved without it; albeit we have not confidence in the water, but in the word of the Goſpell of God, which promiſeth to ſave us by <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> And ſo we ſhall be ſaved in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall judgement, not becauſe we are <hi>Baptized,</hi> but through the faith with which we are Baptized. Where I underſtand <hi>two things:</hi> The one, that to all of us who are Chriſtians, it appertains to ſecure our ſelves in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God with the remembrance that we were baptized, as <hi>Noah</hi> ſecured himſelf in the Floud with the remembrance of the Ark, the Ark being to him that which <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is to us.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:99333:211"/> The other, that we who <hi>are baptized</hi> being children, are to <hi>aſſure our ſelves that we are then really, and</hi> indeed baptized, <hi>when the years of diſcretion being come,</hi> and feeling <hi>by the will of God the voice of the Goſpel, we rejoyce</hi> that we are baptized; in ſuch ſort, <hi>that if ſo be we were not baptized, we would then be baptized:</hi> That betiding to us which might have befallen a man, who had been put into the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> whileſt he was aſleep, who being awaked, and finding himſelf in the Ark, would have thanked <hi>Noah</hi> that had put him in the Ark; affirming, that if he had not been entred therein, and could have entred, he would without all doubt have entred therein. So that as that man being entred into the Ark not by his own faith, but by the Faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> ſhould have ſaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Ark by his own faith, eſteeming it good, that he had entred into the Ark: ſo we who in our infancies were baptized, having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Baptiſme, not through our own Faith, but by the Faith of them who put us therein, ſhall be ſaved in Baptiſme by our own faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and holding it for good that we were baptized.</p>
               <p>Another thing alſo may be ſaid, that as the Beaſts which <hi>Noah</hi> put into the Ark entred in by the faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> and were ſaved in the Floud by the faith of <hi>Noah,</hi> they having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of good nor evil, to enter into
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:99333:211"/> the Ark, or to approve their entring in, but being put into it: ſo the children of Chriſtians, who enter into Baptiſme by the faith of their Parents, and come not to the age to be able to approve or reprove that which their Fathers have done; they, becauſe they have not the knowledge of good or evil, ſhall be ſaved in the day of judgement, by the faith with which their Fathers have put them into Baptiſme. In effect exceeding great is the force and efficacie of Faith, I ſay of that which giving credit to the promiſes of God, ſtands certain of the fulfilling of them, ſhewing its aſſurance by putting in execution that outward thing, which on Gods behalf is commanded. This Faith ſaved <hi>Noah</hi> in the Floud by means of the Ark, and this Faith ſhall ſave all us in the day of judgement, by the means of Baptiſme; us, who believing the Goſpel ſhall be <hi>Baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> to whom be glory for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

The firſt is <hi>Malice.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>Inconſiderateneſſe.</hi> The third is <hi>Incredulity.</hi> In this manner from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtanding in unbelief, from his not believing that Chriſt was the Sonne of God, that he was the promiſed Meſſias in the Law, that he died for the ſinnes of every one, that he was raiſed up for the reſurrection of every one, and that he was glorified for the glorification of every one, it proceeded, that he perſecuted and ſlew them that did believe and preach this, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to do ſervice to God, as from ſtep to ſtep others have done with the ſame intentions which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, who as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, have erred and do erre againſt God; not by <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderateneſſe;</hi> for he, and they go with attention to that which they do; nor through <hi>Malice;</hi> for they do not hate for their own intereſt thoſe whom they perſecute, but through <hi>Infidelity,</hi> becauſe they do not believe in Chriſt. Whence I underſtand it proceeded, that God uſing
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99333:212"/> mercy with S. <hi>Paul</hi> gave him to know Chriſt, and ſo of a famous perſecutour he became a moſt famous Preacher; the ſame mercy and pardon hath been given, as I underſtand, to all them who have erred as S. <hi>Paul</hi> erred. From the Gentiles, who were Miniſters and executers of Chriſts death, not conſidering what they did, proceeded that they <hi>erred inconſiderately</hi> killing the innocent, as many Gentiles have erred, who have been the death of many Chriſtians, not conſidering what they do. For if they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as they ought, there is no doubt they would not do it. And therefore becauſe they erre as Beaſts, their errour is not put to their accompt. This I believe, holding for certain that God did heare Chriſt, when he ſaid, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, forgive them, for they know not what they do!</hi> And S. <hi>Steven,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Lord, lay not this ſinne to their charge!</hi> From that the Scribes and Phariſees minds ſtood full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt Chriſt, as have been and are from time to time full of indignation againſt them that imitate Chriſt, the minds of thoſe, who being like unto the Scribes and Phariſees make profeſſion of outward holineſſe, being void of the inward, it did proceed, and is come to paſſe, and goes on proceeding, that <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly</hi> killing them whom they have known and do know to be members of Chriſt, who have been alwayes hated of the Saints of the world,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:99333:213"/> becauſe they ruine and throw down that ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereof they make profeſſion. With them I do not underſtand that God uſeth mercy: For they ſtand not as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did, in <hi>Incredulity,</hi> that is, not incredulity which maketh them erre, but their errour proceeds from their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> and <hi>Malignity.</hi> Nor do I underſtand that Chriſt prayed, nor that his members pray for them; for their errour ariſeth not through <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſſe,</hi> but from <hi>Malignant deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nay this ſinne I underſtand is that which Chriſt calls Matth. 12.21. <hi>The ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>ſhall not be pardoned, neither in this nor in the other world.</hi> And this ſinne I underſtand Saint <hi>John</hi> calls <hi>a ſinne unto death,</hi> John 5.16.</p>
               <p>The men who imitating the Scribes and Phariſees, erre through <hi>ignorance ariſing of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> I underſtand they have left to be men, and are infernall ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The men who imitating the Gentiles who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſt, erre through <hi>ignorance ariſing from inconſiderateneſſe,</hi> I underſtand they have left to be men, and are beaſts. And the men who imitating S. <hi>Paul,</hi> erre through <hi>ignorance bred from incredulity,</hi> are as I underſtand truly men, to whom <hi>incredulity</hi> is as proper, as <hi>Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> is proper to Beaſts, and as <hi>malice</hi> is proper to the infernall ſpirits. And therefore the errour which grows from incredulity and
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:99333:213"/> inconſiderateneſſe without mixture of malice, finds mercy with God, he being drawn to the faith who erres through ignorance bred of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity. Whereupon if any ask me, ſaying, Whence doſt thou think that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through ignorance, grew, of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Rom. 20. <hi>For being ignorant of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſſe they have not ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves to the righteouſneſſe of God?</hi> I anſwer him, that it was bred partly from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,</hi> and partly from <hi>Incredulity,</hi> through the hatred which they bore unto the Goſpel. That this is true is proved by this, that ſome believed, and others remained in their unbelief. The ſame I anſwer to him that ſhall demand of me, Whence did proceed, and doth proceed the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring through ignorance in them, of whom Chriſt ſaith, John 16.2. <hi>Every one that ſhall kill you, will think that he doth God good ſervice?</hi> And ſo much the more, by how much to me it is proved that S. <hi>Paul</hi> was one of theſe, and found mercy: for his erring through ignorance, grew from incredulity.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I learn this; That every man ought to ſtand on his watch, not to appaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate himſelf at any time in the things that appertain to religion: I mean in defending one thing, and impugning another with paſſion, to the end that the paſſion may not blind him in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99333:214"/> ſuch manner as he come to erre againſt God through <hi>Ignorance bred of malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further I learn, that a man ought not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due conſideration to ſet himſelf to any of thoſe things which ſhall offer themſelves unto him, much leſſe to thoſe which belong to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to the end that he come not to be counted in the number of Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Further I learn, that a man who finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf free from paſſion and inconſideration, that he erre not againſt God, ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himſelf to be in Incredulity, and ſo to pray God, that he would free him from it. And in the mean ſpace he ought to abſtain from put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in execution thoſe things which are in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his neighbour; (as S. Pauls perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtians was,) And then the more, when they ſhall ſeem to him more holy, and more juſt before God.</p>
               <p>And I learn further, that onely the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Chriſtian being more then a man, being gone out of Incredulity, doch not erre through <hi>Malice, Inconſideration,</hi> or <hi>Incredulity,</hi> but erring onely through frailty, inaſmuch as he hath not yet left altogether to be a man, hath not as yet altogether comprehended the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an perfection, wherein he is comprehended by the incorporation with which he ſtands incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated in the death, in the reſurrection, and in the glorification of the ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That that which the Scripture calls the knowledge of Good and Evil, the wiſe men of the world have called, and do call naturall light, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and humane reaſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY that which I read of the Creation, and Depravation of man, I conſider that a man was firſt created after the image and likeneſſe of God, and was put in the garden which they call earthly Paradiſe; and afterwards eating of the fruit of the <hi>Tree of knowledge of good and evil,</hi> loſt the image and likeneſſe of God, and was driven out of the earthly Paradiſe, remaining with <hi>the knowledge of good and evil:</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that as it is not naturall for a man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his firſt creation to abide out of earthly Paradiſe, ſo it is not primarily naturall to him to have <hi>the knowledge of good and evil.</hi> And by that which I experiment in the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man in his regeneration and renovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, conſidering that for the accepting of the grace of the Goſpel, the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reconciliation with God by the juſtice of God executed on Chriſt, that ſo he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of God, and to recover the image and ſimilitude of God, and to have the government of the holy ſpirit he is neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to captivate his underſtanding, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and mortifie his prudence, humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and naturall light; I underſtand that that
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99333:215"/> which holy Scripture calls the <hi>knowledge of good and evil, the wiſe men of the world have called and do call naturall light, prudence, and humane reaſon.</hi> And ſo I come to underſtand, that a man is neceſſitated to captivate his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to mortifie his own prudence and naturall light, which is the ſame as to renounce <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> that he may obtain Chriſtian reparation, regeneration and renovation. For it is a moſt juſt thing, that if he be to recover that which he loſt, he ſhould firſt renounce that which he gained, that is, if he would recover his ſpirituall light, he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his naturall light. And if we grant (as it is neceſſary to grant by that which we read, and experiment) that the reparation of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature by Chriſtian regeneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, conſiſts in this, that a man accepting the Goſpel, and being incorporated in Chriſt, goes recovering the being, the degree and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities, in which the firſt man was created; and goes on leaving the being, the degree and the dignity, in which the firſt man remained after that he was depraved; It is likewiſe neceſſary, that we ſhould grant, that as that which we gain is not naturall to the being which we now hold, ſo likewiſe that which we leave was not naturall to the being which we had according to our firſt creation. Whereby we come clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand, that the naturall light which
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:99333:215"/> we now hold, is not from our firſt creation, but from our depravation. And beſides this, that the ſpirituall light which we gain by Chriſt, is from our firſt creation. And this ſpirituall light I underſtand was ſo naturall to a man in his firſt creation, as the <hi>knowledge of good and evil,</hi> and naturall light is now naturall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And I ſuppoſe, that the firſt man not acknowledging the ſpirituall light for a thing properly his, but communicated to him by the favour of God, did deſire <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> pretending that that would be to him, as it is, naturall. And of <hi>this knowledge of good and evil,</hi> I underſtand that a man gets a greater or leſſer part, according as he is more or leſſe purged, and purified in his affections and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, which are according to the fleſh. Whence I ſuppoſe the wiſe men of the world have taken occaſion to believe, that <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil</hi> is a ſpirituall thing, and is of the firſt creation of man; not conſidering that this effect proceeds hence, that as <hi>the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil,</hi> and the naturall light is a perfection of man in the ſtate of his depravation, ſo the ſpirituall light was in the ſtate of his firſt creation, and is in the ſtate of his reparation.</p>
               <p>Againſt that which hath been ſpoken two things offer themſelves: The firſt, that by that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. that <hi>the Gentiles by their naturall light might have known God,</hi>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:99333:216"/> and by that which he ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. That <hi>they might have naturally known the will of God,</hi> it ſeems, that the naturall light is not of the ſtate of the depravation of man, but of the ſtate of his firſt creation. The ſecond, that it being true, the old Saints as <hi>David,</hi> and the new Saints as S, <hi>Paul,</hi> in that which they have written have ſerved themſelves of naturall light, of Prudence and humane reaſon, it ſeems that it is not evil, nor that it ought to be renounced, left and mortified. To the firſt I underſtand it may be anſwered, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> willing to convince the Gentiles, inaſmuch as they did excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying that they could not know God, and therefore worſhiped him not; nor could know the will of God, and therefore they had lived viciouſly; he ſhews them, that although they had not had the knowledge of God to worſhip him, nor yet of the will of God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it, (which knowledge being by ſpirituall light was in the firſt man before his depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and abides in Chriſtians in our reparation,) nor the knowledge which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had by their holy Scriptures; yet, that they having had the knowledge, that can be gotten with the naturall light by the contemplation of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by the teſtimony of their conſciences; and not having done according to that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and that will of God, they came to be in fault; neither did there remain any excuſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99333:216"/> at all to them. So that from the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> it cannot be gathered, that a Chriſtian man is not to renounce his naturall light, but that the naturall light ſufficeth to know God in a certain manner, and to underſtand the will of God.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond thing I underſtand it may be anſwered, that the Saints ſerve themſelves in their writings of <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> in that of which it is capable; (in which it is alſo illuſtrated in them by the ſpirituall light) And that they have renounced it, and mortified it in that of which it is incapable; that is, in the juſtification by Chriſt, in the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, in the regiment and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the holy Spirit, and generally in all celeſtiall, ſpirituall, and divine things. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand indeed that the happineſſe and perfection of a man, would be much more greater, if that <hi>the knowledge of good and evil</hi> were totally extinct, and dead, and the ſpirituall light were totally kindled, and alive in them. But I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the fleſh as it is paſſible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, is not a ſubject fit for ſo great felicity. And I underſtand that this ſhall be after the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when it ſhall have obtained impaſſibility and immortality; in the mean time it is neceſſary, that the Saints ſhould ſerve themſelves with the knowledge of good and evil, and with naturall light, becauſe they converſe, and deal toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:99333:217"/> with men, who ſerve themſelves with the ſame knowledge, &amp; with the ſame light, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that the counſell of Chriſt, <hi>be you wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> Matth. 20. and that which Saint Paul ſaith, <hi>be you wiſe in underſtanding,</hi> 1. Cor. 14.</p>
               <p>Here two things offer themſelves unto me:</p>
               <p>The firſt, becauſe <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> the <hi>naturall light, prudence</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon</hi> are in a man through his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God, and are in the ſtate of depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it comes to paſſe that this knowledge, this light, and this prudence never give man true fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, nay rather as Solomon affirms, Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes 1.18. <hi>As ſcience, light and wiſdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, ſo affliction, anguiſh and ſorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe;</hi> and therefore felicity decreaſeth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, conſidering that Adam before he had <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> was not aſhamed to ſtand naked; and after he had <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> was aſhamed and clothed himſelf; I come to underſtand, that whileſt a man hath the ſpirituall light, and ſerves himſelf thereof, he knows no defect in any of the works of God, nor doth pretend to correct and amend them. And whileſt he hath <hi>the knowledge of good and evil,</hi> and ſerves himſelf thereof, he knows defects in the works of God, and pretends to correct and amend them; ſuch is the arrogancy of men, who glory to have <hi>the knowledge of good and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:99333:217"/> evil,</hi> to have much naturall light, much pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and much humane reaſon. And ſuch is the humility of the men which have the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all light, that they look upon all the works of God, and acknowledge them to be moſt perfect, holy and good; theſe are they who ſtand in the kingdome of God, ſtanding by the faith of the Goſpel, incorporated in the ſonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In what manner from a mans not knowing himſelf, nor God, there is cauſed in him an impoſſibility in accepting the grace of the Goſpel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY how much the more I ſet my ſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly to conſider the benefit of Chriſt, conſidering that it is in all, and upon all them that accept it, ſo much the more do I marvell, that all men runne not after it, and embrace it, and ſet it in their hearts; there being offered unto them by way of gift, the remiſſion of their ſinnes, reconciliation with God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immortality, and life with Chriſt; And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſet my ſelf many times to conſider whence it may proceed, that all they who have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this moſt ſingular grace, do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; I underſtand, that it proceeds from a mans not <hi>knowing either himſelf or God.</hi> And in effect it comes to paſſe, that man not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in himſelf the impiety, malignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:99333:218"/> which are naturall in him through ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, he doth not diſtruſt himſelf to be able of himſelf to ſatisfie God, and to be juſt before God. In the ſame manner it comes to paſſe, that man not knowing in God bounty, mercy and fidelity, doth not truſt in God, and ſo cannot perſwade himſelf, nor ſecure himſelf in his mind, that the juſtice of God appertains to him, that God accepts him for juſt by reaſon of that which Chriſt ſuffered. And if a man knew himſelf, conſidering himſelf impious, malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and rebellious, not onely of himſelf, but being as he is the ſonne of Adam, he would diſtruſt himſelf to be able of himſelf to juſtifie himſelf. And if he knew God, knowing in him bounty, mercy and fidelity, he would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily truſt himſelf of him, accepting the pardon which the Goſpel offers him; and ſo much the more, as knowing himſelf it would not ſeem ſtrange to him, that God ſhould pardon him without his own merit, the evils and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences wherein he knows himſelf to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, partly without his own proper fault, and partly with his own proper fault, bred, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from that of others: with which as I underſtand <hi>David</hi> excuſed his ſinne, ſaying <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I was ſhapen in wickedneſſe, and in ſinne hath my mother conceived me;</hi> whence I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that as it is impoſſible that a man <hi>not knowing himſelf, nor knowing God, ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:99333:218"/> the grace of the Goſpel,</hi> and ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf with it, ſo it is impoſſible, that a man knowing himſelf, and knowing God, ſhould pretend, or think to juſtifie himſelfe by his own proper works, or to avoid the evil, or to apply himſelf to the good. And if one ſhall ſay unto me, How then did the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Saints who <hi>knew themſelves and knew God,</hi> pretend to Juſtifie themſelves with the ſacrifices which the law commands? I will anſwer, that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> ſaints did not place their juſtifications in their ſacrifices, but in the word of God which promiſed to pardon them, they making thoſe ſacrifices. And here I underſtand, that it was much more difficult to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſaints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew themſelves, and knew God, to reduce themſelves, and to hold themſelves for juſt, ſacrificing; then it is for the Chriſtian ſaints, who know themſelves, and know God, to reduce and hold themſelves for juſt, believing, and accepting the grace of the Goſpel. Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſaints in ſacrificing knew that they gave unto God, that which they themſelves out of their naturall inclination did delight to give him, and that which they knew is not pleaſing in it ſelf, or for it ſelf, nor contents God, as is proved by many things which we read in the old holy Scripture, and is particularly in the 40. and 51. Pſalmes, and Iſaiah. And inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:99333:219"/> alſo as it is moſt certain and true, that the Chriſtian Saints believing, know that they give unto God that which by their naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination they would not give, and that which God delights, and would ſhould be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as is proved by all the Scripture. Whence I take this reſolution, that the men who in the time of the Goſpel pretend to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie themſelves by working, give teſtimony of themſelves, that they know not themſelves nor God. And they who pretend to be juſt by believing, give teſtimony of themſelves, that they know themſelves and know God. Whereupon remembring my ſelf of a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon which I have written, That God did with the Hebrew people giving them a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious law, that which a Merchant doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting for the Levant, and doubting of the chaſtity of his wife, knowing her inclined to compoſe ſonnets, and canzons, he enjoyns her every day to write him a ſonnet on ſome of thoſe things paſſed between them, albeit he delights not in ſonnets. And conſidering, that to the Hebrews, who knew not themſelves nor God, that came to paſſe which might have come to paſſe to the Merchants wife, in caſe that not knowing her own inclination, nor that of her husbands, ſhe ſhould think to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie her ſelf with him giving him ſonnets, having loſt her chaſtity; and conſidering
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:99333:219"/> that to the <hi>Hebrews who knew themſelves and knew God,</hi> that came to paſſe, which might have come to paſſe to the ſame woman, in caſe that ſhe knowing her own inclination, and that of her husbands, ſhould pretend in making ſonnets to obey her husband, and not to wander out or exerciſe her ſelf in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in diſhonour of her husband; I come to know the exceeding great inconvenience wherein they remain, who in the time of the Goſpel pretend, and ſuppoſe to juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by works; yea, and by works which are not commanded them: foraſmuch as they cannot pretend obedience, as the Hebrew ſaints did, which obedience was imputed to them for righteouſneſſe, and held them united with God without committing adultery againſt God, as they who neither knowing themſelves, nor knowing God, did pretend to juſtifie themſelves by ſacrificing.</p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I learn two moſt important things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that ſince it is true, that God demands not now of men that they ſhould ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, demanding of them that they ſhould believe, that they ſhould accept the grace, the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the reconciliation with God which the Goſpel offers them, ſhewing unto them how that God having put on Chriſt the ſinnes of all men, he hath puniſhed them
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:99333:220"/> all in him, and ſo his juſtice reſteth ſatisfied: The man how much ſoever a ſinner and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked he be, who ſhall not hold himſelf pardoned and reconciled with God, and ſo for juſt; ſhall by this give teſtimony of himſelf, that he knows not God, ſince he doth not truſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on his word, and that he doth not know Chriſt, ſince he doth not ſtand aſſured that he is juſt in Chriſt. And if ſuch a man ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to juſtifie himſelf by works, he ſhall give teſtimony of himſelf, that he doth not know the naturall inclination of man; in ſuch ſort, that either I muſt know my ſelf to be juſt in Chriſt, although I know my ſelf a ſinner in my ſelf, or I ought to deny that which the Goſpel affirms, that <hi>God in Chriſt hath puniſhed the ſinnes and iniquities of all men,</hi> and mine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them; or elſe I am conſtrained to ſay, that God is unjuſt, puniſhing ſinnes twice, once in Chriſt, and another time in me. And becauſe to ſay this would be impiety, and to deny the other would be incredulity, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that I enforce my ſelf to account my ſelf pardoned, and reconciled with God, and ſo for juſt in Chriſt, ſubjecting the naturall light to the ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which I learn is, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, that the impoſſibility which is in man to accept this holy Goſpel of Ghriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a mans not knowing himſelf, nor
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99333:220"/> knowing God, it belongs to every man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf in good earneſt to know himſelf and his own naturall inclination, taking it even from Adam; and to know God, taking for his principall application continuall prayer, praying God affectionately and fervently, that he would open the eyes of his mind in ſuch manner, that he may come to theſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements, and praying him that hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to open them, that he would every day more and more open them. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner if he ſhall not have begun to accept the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Goſpel of Chriſt, yet in going on to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the impoſſibility, he ſhall begin to accept it; and if he ſhall have begun to accept it, the difficulty which he finds in accepting it being taken away, he will accept it more and better, faith being efficacious in him to mortifie him, and to make him alive, with which things the Chriſtian faith is confirmed in us, which is the foundation in that moſt divine confeſſion of Saint Peter, Matth. 16.16. when he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Sonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> to whom be glory for ever Amen.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>In what manner the evil of Adams diſobedience ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to us all: and the good of Chriſts obedience reacheth unto us all.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY that which I read in holy Scripture, and by that which I know in my ſelf, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that for to come to believe the <hi>good of Christs obedience,</hi> and that in <hi>Christs obedience we all obeyed,</hi> &amp; that in Chriſts raiſing up we all aroſe; it is convenient and neceſſary to believe the <hi>diſobedience of Adam,</hi> and that <hi>Adam diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying we all diſobeyed,</hi> and that in Adams dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we all dyed. I ſay it is neceſſary for every man to believe the evil of Adam, that he may come to believe the good of Chriſt. For I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it is impoſſible that a man ſhould believe the good of Chriſt, if he do not believe the evil of Adam. Inaſmuch as not believing it he ſhall not feel it, and not feeling it he ſhall not deſire it, nor procure to free himſelf from it, and not deſiring not procuring it, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to believe the good of Chriſt, which is the proper medicine againſt the evil of Adam. But if he believe the evil of Adam, together with the believing it, he will feel it, finding himſelf in himſelf impious, unfaithfull, and the enemy of God; and as he ſhall know himſelf to be come into ſuch impiety, and infidelity, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity without his own proper fault, ſo he will eaſily reduce himſelf to believe to be able to
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:99333:221"/> come unto piety, fidelity, and friendſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own proper merit; whereupon he will believe the good of Chriſt, and believing it he will feel it, feeling himſelf more faithfull, and more the friend of God in Chriſt; and then ſhall know with effect, that as <hi>the evil of Adams diſobedience,</hi> whileſt he did not believe, and not believing it did not feel it, was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to make him by his own fault more impious, more unfaithfull, and more the enemy of God: ſo <hi>the good of the obedience of Chriſt</hi> is in the ſame manner efficacious, whileſt he believes it, and whileſt believing it he feels it, to make him in himſelf more faithfull, and more the friend of Chriſt. Whence I underſtand, that as they who believe the evil of Adam, do free themſelves from it, and they who believe the good of Chriſt, do enioy it: ſo they who do not believe the evil of Adam, do not free themſelves from it, and they who do not believe the good of Chriſt, do not enjoy it. It is very true, that as they who believe <hi>the evil of Adam and the good of Chriſt,</hi> paſſe through <hi>the evil of Adam, and the good of Chriſt</hi> is in part ſuſpended in them: ſo they who do not believe neither <hi>the evil of Adam nor the good of Chriſt,</hi> paſſe through <hi>the good of Chriſt, and the evil of Adam</hi> is ſuſpended in them. Inaſmuch as they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, paſſe through the miſeries of this preſent life, and through death, which are things of the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:99333:222"/> evil of Adam; whileſt they ſtand in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, and whileſt their bodies abide in the ſepulchres, the good of Chriſt is in part ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them. And as they who do not believe, paſſe in this preſent life through the good of Chriſt, enjoying many things together with them that believe the good of Chriſt; and in eternall life becauſe they ſhall be raiſed up, the evil of Adam ſhall be ſuſpended in them: ſo I underſtand as the evil of Adam was efficacious to make us all die, from which death notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they who believe are free; ſo the good of Chriſt is efficacious to raiſe us all up; of which Reſurrection notwithſtanding they ſhall have no ioy, who do not believe, becauſe they ſhall not be in good eſtate therein. <hi>In Adam we all die, in Christ we all ariſe,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.22. And in the evil of Adam ſhall they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, who ſhall not accept the good of Chriſt. But in the good of Chriſt none ſhall remain, but onely they who have believed him, and ſhall have accepted and felt it. For in effect the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt ſhall not be glorious, but onely for them, who believing themſelves to be dead in Adam, and raiſed up in Chriſt, ſhall give themſelves to live in this preſent life, as dead and raiſed up, beginning even now to live a life much like unto that, which they have to live in life everlaſting; ſo that as the Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an imperfect Reſurrection, ſo the Chriſtian
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99333:222"/> living in the ſtate of this Vivification is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, albeit in reſpect of the living in the ſtate of Depravation it is moſt perfect. And the draught of living in the ſtate of the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inaſmuch as it is imitable in the ſtate of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification, we ſee in Jeſus Chriſt our Lord in his purity, bounty, fidelity, obedience and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And here I learn two things. The one, that ſince a man believing <hi>the evil of Adam,</hi> frees himſelf from it, and believing <hi>the good of Chriſt,</hi> enjoyes it; it belongs to every one to believe <hi>this evil,</hi> and <hi>this good,</hi> not expecting for all that to feel it, that he may believe it; for this were to pervert the order which God hath ſet, who will that we ſhall believe before we feel; but believing that he may feel it: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving together both the evil and the good, the efficacy of the good will deprive us of the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the evil, in this preſent life in part, and altogether in life eternall; inaſmuch as we ſhall be then altogether free from the <hi>evil of Adam,</hi> and altogether intent to enjoy <hi>the good of Chriſt.</hi> The other thing which I here learn, is, that they who in this preſent life do not give themſelves to live as dead and raiſed up, imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the life of Chriſt, do not believe that they dyed in Adam, and that they roſe again in Chriſt, how much ſoever they ſay and affirm that they believe both the one and the other. For if they did believe them, there is no doubt
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:99333:223"/> but they would apply themſelves to live as dead and raiſed up, this being properly the efficacy of Faith, to reduce by little and little them that believe themſelves in truth to be dead in Adam and raiſed up in Chriſt, to live as dead and as raiſed up; not becauſe they intend to become juſt, but becauſe they do now know and feel themſelves juſt in Chriſt, and becauſe they hope for the crown of juſtice, that is, immortality and life eternall. And here I will adde this, that as the acceptation of the indulgence, which a King makes unto them that being fled for ſome exceſſe out of his kingdome, and remain in the ſervice of another King, is efficacious to make them leave the ſtrange kingdome, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſtrange king, and return to their own kingdome, to ſerve their own King: ſo the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the Goſpel is efficacious to make, that all men who accept it, leaving the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, and the ſervice of the world, ſhould come unto the kingdome of God, and to the ſervice of God: and that leaving to live according to the fleſh, they ſhould live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſpirit: ſo that they who leave not the kingdome of the world, and the ſervice of the world, and the living according to the fleſh; give teſtimony of themſelves, that they have not well accepted the Goſpel, how much ſoever they ſay they believe it, no otherwiſe then they who do not leave the ſtrange kingdome, and
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99333:223"/> the ſervice of the ſtrange King, returning into their own kingdome, to ſerve their own king; give teſtimony of themſelves, that they do not accept the indulgence of their King, how much ſoever they ſay they accept it, and believe it, ſince they do not the will of the king, which would the ſame from them, which God would from us; that is, that we ſhould leave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the world, and the ſervice of the world, and that we ſhould come unto the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God to ſerve God in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and in the Goſpel of his onely begotten ſonne Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>DEſiring to reſolve my ſelf in the knowledge <hi>which as a Chriſtian I ought to have of Chriſt,</hi> I conſider in him <hi>two generations,</hi> the one <hi>divine,</hi> and the other <hi>humane:</hi> and <hi>two times,</hi> the one of <hi>ſhame,</hi> and the other of <hi>glory.</hi> According to the divine generation I know that Chriſt is the <hi>word</hi> of God, the ſonne of God, of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father, and one and the ſame with him, ſo like unto him that he might well ſay to <hi>Philip, Philip, he that ſeeth me, ſeeth my Father alſo,</hi> John 14. This as I underſtand is that <hi>Word</hi> with which God
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:99333:224"/> created all things according as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>God ſaid Let there be light;</hi> And according to that which <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>by the word of the Lord were the Heavens made.</hi> Pſalm. 33.6. With this <hi>word,</hi> I underſtand that God main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all things, conformable to that, <hi>In him was life,</hi> John 1. And to that, <hi>Upholding all things by the word of his power.</hi> Hebrews 1. This <hi>word</hi> I underſtand, by the work of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit in the wombe of the moſt holy Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, God clothed with fleſh, with intent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair all things by him, as he made all things by him, and maintains all things with him. And I underſtand that this word of God, as Iſaiah ſaith, chap. 53. <hi>was proſperous in Chriſt;</hi> inaſmuch as that came to paſſe, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in him, and by him. And ſo I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is one and the ſelf ſame <hi>word,</hi> that of which S. John ſaith, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God:</hi> and more beneath, <hi>And the word was made fleſh:</hi> and that which S. Paul ſaith <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>For by him all things were created, that are in heaven, &amp; that are in earth.</hi> But ſetting my ſelf to ſearch in what thing this divine generation of the ſon of God, of the <hi>Word</hi> of God doth conſiſt, in what manner the ſon is generated of the father, for what cauſe the <hi>Word</hi> is called the Sonne, and the Sonne is called the <hi>Word,</hi> I find my ſelf ſo incapable of this knowledge, that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:99333:224"/> I anew confirm my ſelf in that which I have written in the 95. Conſideration; That as the worms which are bred of the corruption of the earth, are altogether uncapable of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by which one man is generated by another; even ſo the men who are generated by carnall generation, are altogether uncapable, not onely of the manner how the Son of God was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but alſo of the manner how the ſonnes of God are regenerated by the holy ſpirit of God. And if I ſhould underſtand in what manner Moſes, and David, and Saint John, and Saint Paul underſtood it, that God created all things by his word, I ſhould alſo underſtand this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſecret, which I go ſearching out. Wherein I go conſidering the power, wherewith Chriſt alſo in his humble ſtate did that which he would, being ſuddenly obeyed by his creatures, none of them giving any further impediment, then was granted unto them. If it ſhall pleaſe God, that I be capable of this divine ſecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go out of this preſent life, I will alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn that here which he ſhall teach me to his glory, and the glory of Chriſt, and the good of thoſe who are the ſonnes of God in Chriſt, and through Chriſt. Otherwiſe I will content my ſelf with this; for I am ſure, that I ſhall ſee with theſe corporall eyes in life eternall, that which at preſent I deſire to ſee with the eyes of my mind. And in the mean ſpace I
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99333:225"/> rejoyce in this, that at preſent I know that this <hi>Word</hi> of God, this ſonne of God, with whom and by whom God hath created, and repaired all things, is of the ſelf ſame ſubſtance of the Father, and one ſelf ſame thing with him, and is eternall as he is. I underſtand, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit accommodating it ſelf to our incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſpeaking with us, uſeth theſe words uſed amongſt us, ſuch as are <hi>word and ſonne,</hi> not to the end, and by them we ſhould comprehend the divine ſecret, but becauſe we may have ſome name to expreſſe him by. According to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine generation I underſtand, that Chriſt is the firſt begotten ſon of God by his eternity, that he was alwayes the Sonne, and that he is the onely begotten ſonne of God by his ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he is onely the Sonne by generation, all others that are ſonnes being ſonnes by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For what belongs to the divine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Chriſt, I underſtand that in him was neither diminution, nor augmentation. He was the ſame before his incarnation, that he was in his incarnation, and that he is in his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>According to the humane generation I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that Chriſt by the work of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was generated in the womb of the moſt holy Virgin, in what manner I know not, to me it ſufficeth to know, that the fleſh with which the <hi>Word</hi> of God clothed it ſelf in this world,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:99333:225"/> was taken from that moſt holy Virgin, and according to this fleſh I know Chriſt for the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> and of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And I ſee now in part fulfilled in him, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God made unto <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 89.34.35. aſmuch as belongs to the perpetuity of the Kingdome in his ſeed; and thoſe made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ. 13.16. and chap. 22.17. aſmuch as belongs to the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his ſeed, and aſmuch as belongs to the inheritance of the world. And I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſee them intirely complete in life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, the reſurrection of the juſt being made.</p>
               <p>According to this humane generation I know in Chriſt two times: the one of ſhame, and the other of glory. In the time of his ſhame I know him a man paſſible and mortall, with all the miſeries which being annexed unto paſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and mortality, do grow in man that lives in poverty. And I know him with fleſh like unto mine, ſaving that his was not ſinfull fleſh, nor fleſh ſubject unto ſinne as mine is. In this time I know Chriſt moſt humble and moſt meek, he eſteeming himſelf for that which he was, in that being in which he ſtood clothed with fleſh, as one diſguiſed amongſt men, that he might be handled of men as a man. In this ſelf ſame time I know Chriſt moſt obedient to his eternall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, moſt clean from all ſinne, and therefore
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:99333:226"/> moſt juſt, and moſt holy; in ſuch manner as he might ſecurely ſay to them who perſecuted him and calumniated him, <hi>Who of you can convince me of ſinne?</hi> Joh. 8. And S. Paul ſpeaking of him might well ſay, (2. Cor. 5.21.) <hi>He who knew no ſin.</hi> And S. Peter 1.2. <hi>Who did no ſin nor was any guile found in his mouth.</hi> And of this innocency of Chriſt all the Scriptures are full, as of a moſt neceſſary thing to be underſtood of all them who know themſelves juſt in him, and by him.</p>
               <p>In the time of glory I know Chriſt a man impaſſible and immortall, and I know him moſt glorious and moſt triumphant, as he who hath gotten abſolute power in heaven and in earth, having obtained the kingdome of God, and the inheritance of God for Gods elect, having ſlain all of them in him, raiſed them all up in him, &amp; glorified them all in him: &amp; ſo that comes to be true of them, which is of him. In this time I know Chriſt for Lord, for Head, and for King of the people of God, of the Church of God, and of the elect of God. I know Chriſt for Lord of the elect of God, becauſe he hath redeemed them with his precious bloud, delivering them from ſinne, from hell, and from death, in which things the firſt man had ſet them, and unto which things he had obliged and made them ſubject. And becauſe the Apoſtles in their writings do joy to call Chriſt Holy, they know Chriſt for the Head of the Church of God: For God
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:99333:226"/> having put in him his holy Spirit with all the treaſures of his divinity, he communicates and diſtributes them moſt liberally to thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated in him, appertain to the Church of God, to every one according to his capacity, doing with them that which my head doth with my body: that as my hand if it could ſpeak, would ſay and affirm, that it feels that from my head there deſcends a vitall virtue, by means whereof it lives; ſo every one of thoſe who being incorporated in Chriſt are of the Church of God, becauſe he can ſpeak, ſaith and affirmeth, that he feels that from Chriſt there comes unto him a ſpirituall virtue, by means whereof he lives a ſpirituall life. This S. <hi>John</hi> thus underſtood, (chap. 1.16.) when he ſaid. <hi>For of his fulneſſe have we all received, and grace for grace:</hi> and ſo S. Paul underſtood it, Coloſſ. 1.18. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> I know Chriſt for King in the people of God; for I underſtand that he is he who with his ſpirit rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns it, not onely in inward things and divine, as Head, but alſo as God: and in outward and corporall things, as King. In all which things being as they are the ſonnes of God, as Saint Paul ſaith, Rom. 8, 14. <hi>they are led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</hi> And ſo I underſtand that the kingdome of God is not called the ſpirituall kingdome, becauſe he governs us in ſpirituall
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99333:227"/> things; but becauſe governing us in ſpirituall and corporall things he doth not govern us with the outward law, but with the inward law, which is the government of the Holy Spirit and the Chriſtian ſpirit. Of this kingdome of Chriſt the holy Scriptures are full. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 5. <hi>Mic.</hi> 5. <hi>Daniel.</hi> 7. By which I underſtand that in this preſent life God reigns, but by Chriſt; and that in life eternall God ſhall reign, but by himſelf onely: For then <hi>he ſhall be all in all.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>In this manner I know Chriſt glorious for King of the people of God, for Head of the Church of God, and for Lord of the Elect of God. And I know Chriſt humble, moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and free from all ſinne, and abounding in all juſtice: And I know fullfilled in him in part the promiſes of God made to <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>Abraham.</hi> And I know him for the Sonne of God firſt-born, and onely begotten and I know that he is the <hi>Word</hi> of God with which God created all things; and I know him eternall and conſubſtantiall. And I hold for certain, that as the Chriſtian faith ſhall go on being in me more efficacious, mortifying me and quickening me: ſo theſe knowledges of Chriſt ſhall go on being more clear, and more diſtinct, by which I ſhall go on from day to day, alwayes more knowing God as he may be known, whileſt this fleſh being paſſible and mortall, is not a ſubject to ſee Chriſt, and <hi>to ſee God face to face,</hi> as I ſhall ſee him in life eternall.</p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:99333:227"/>
               <p>Having taken this reſolution in the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which I ought to have of Christ,</hi> I go re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving my ſelf in the <hi>knowledge that I ought to have of them who are the members of Chriſt,</hi> conſidering every one of them a Sonne of God; not firſt-born as Chriſt, who alwayes was a Sonne, but an adopted Sonne by Chriſt, and in Chriſt; not begotten as Chriſt, who is the ſonne by generation, but regenerated by Chriſt and in Chriſt, born the ſonne of wrath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born the ſonne of God; not in the ſtate of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in which Chriſt is, but in the ſtate of opprobry, in which Chriſt was; not Lord of Gods elect, but one of the number of them, who being elected of God are the ſervants of Chriſt, redeemed and bought by Chriſt; not head of the Church of God as Chriſt, but a member of the Church of God, of which Chriſt is the head; not King of the people of God as Chriſt, but governed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, by means of which ſpirit I know that all the members of Chriſt ſtand united amongſt themſelves, and united with Chriſt himſelf, and therefore united alſo with God, God abiding in them, and they in God. And ſo I ſee fullfilled that Prayer, which Chriſt made unto his Father for this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>John</hi> 17.) ſaying, <hi>That they may be one in us.</hi> And I underſtand, that in this union conſiſteth all the chriſtian perfection. I pray God, that he do in ſuch manner imprint this in
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:99333:228"/> my memory, that it may not ſever it ſelf, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from it, not ſo much as for one moment, to the intent that I never may do any thing which ſhall not be worthy of this union, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge from my Chriſt who is my <hi>Lord,</hi> my <hi>Head,</hi> and my <hi>King.</hi> To him be glory with the Father, and the holy ſpirit. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>A Moſt great teſtimony of Chriſtian life is this, that according as a chriſtian man goes perfecting himſelf in his chriſtian cuſtoms, ſo he goes clearing himſelf in his chriſtian concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

And therefore it is ſure to ſay, that both the one, and the other comes from the chriſtian ſpirit, which doth mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly work both the one and the other in them who accept the Goſpel of Chriſt.

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:99333:229"/> as themſelves.</hi> And I ſay further, that as whileſt they, who approve thoſe three morall vertues not poſſeſſing them, albeit they willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heare talk of them, through the deſire which they have to poſſeſſe them; yet it is not ſo much as that it gives them entire ſatisfaction: nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when they look upon themſelves, and find themſelves without them, they grieve themſelves, and are malecontent, and ſo much the more as it ſeems to them that the vertues are more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe they do more looſe the hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to obtain them: ſo likewiſe they, who approve theſe <hi>three gifts of God</hi> not poſſeſſing them, albeit they rejoyce to heare ſpeak of them, through the deſire which they have to poſſeſſe them; yet is it not ſo much as that it gives them entire ſatisfaction: nay rather, when they look upon themſelves, and find themſelves without them, they grieve themſelves, and ſtand male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and ſo much the more as it ſeems to them that the gifts are the more perfect, becauſe they ſo much more looſe the hope of obtaining them. Further I ſay, that as when it ſhould happen, that thoſe men who approve the three morrall vertues not poſſeſſing them, ſhould come to poſſeſſe them, knowing themſelves magnanimous, valiant, and liberall; they would affirm that they never well underſtood what thing theſe three vertues were, and would after a much other manner rejoyce to hear ſpeak of
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:99333:229"/> them, knowing them to be in themſelves: and albeit it would grieve them when they knew themſelves imperfect in them, yet it would not grieve them that they ſhould be ſo perfect as they are. So likewiſe when it befalls that the men who approve the three gifts of God not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing them come to poſſeſſe them, becauſe God gives them unto them, knowing themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with <hi>Faith,</hi> with <hi>Hope,</hi> and with <hi>Charity,</hi> they affirm that <hi>they never well underſtood what theſe three gifts of God were,</hi> and do moſt fully rejoyce and ſatisfie themſelves to heare ſpeak of them; and ſo much the more, inaſmuch as they ſpeak more highly of them, becauſe they know them in themſelves. And albeit they are ſorry, and grieve themſelves, when looking upon themſelves they know themſelves imperfect in them, yet it grieves them not that they be ſo perfect as they are; nay rather they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and (if it were poſſible,) they would adde unto them much more perfection. So much is the ſatisfaction which they find in believing, hoping, and loving. In this manner I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that as none is capable of knowing what it is to be magnanimous, or valiant, or liberall, but onely he who hath magnanimity, valour, and liberality: ſo none is capable of knowing what Believing, Hoping, and Loving are, but he who through the Chriſtian ſpirit hath the gift of <hi>Faith, Hope, and Charity.</hi> And ſo it
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:99333:230"/> comes to paſſe to be ſo true, that a man may as it were touch it with his hand, <hi>That ſpirituall and Christian gifts are not underſtood untill they be poſſeſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this diſcourſe I underſtand all this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it being true, that none are cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of the gifts of God to underſtand them, but they onely who have them, it appertains to every perſon that would underſtand them, firſt to demand them of God, and not to think that he underſtands them untill that he know them, and feel them in himſelf, as the magnanimous knows, and feels magnanimity in himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they may ſay that they know, and feel the gifts of God in them, who find en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſatisfaction, when they heare others ſpeak of Chriſtian matters; and albeit they are ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, and grieve themſelves, when they ſee themſelves imperfect in them; yet they rejoyce, and content themſelves that they ſhould be ſo perfect as they are; conſidering that by how much they are the more perfect, by ſo much the more doth the glory of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and of God come to be illuſtrated, and ſo much doth the baſeneſſe and the vileneſſe, the infirmity and the weakneſſe of man come to be more known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that as one in being magnanimous hath magnanimity in being valiant hath valour, in being liberall hath liberality; ſo in ones ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the grace of the Goſpel, he hath <hi>Faith,</hi>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:99333:230"/> and is <hi>Juſt,</hi> and in <hi>deſiring the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> hath <hi>Hope,</hi> and is <hi>holy;</hi> and in <hi>Loving God and his neighbours, hath charity,</hi> and is pious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> that as the magnanimous doth not looſe his magnanimity for twiſe or thriſe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into puſillanimity, except he neglect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch manner that forgetting to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous he becomes puſillanimous. And what I ſay of the magnanimous, I ſay of the valiant, and of the liberall. So the juſt man by Chriſtian faith doth not looſe the juſtice of Chriſt for committing two or three iniquities, except he neglect himſelf in ſuch ſort of the Faith, that forgetting himſelf of his being juſt by faith he become unjuſt. And that which I ſay of the Juſt, I ſay of the Holy through Hope, and I ſay of the Pious through Charity: ſo if one demand of me ſaying, whether I believe, that he who hath by the <hi>gift of God Faith, Hope and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> can come to looſe his juſtice, his Holineſſe, and his Piety, which he hath gotten with <hi>Faith, with Hope, and with Charity.</hi> I ſay unto him, that if it be poſſible that he ſhould come to looſe his Faith, his Hope and his Charity, it will be alſo poſſible, for him to looſe his Juſtice, his Holineſſe and his Piety, theſe being the effects of thoſe. And I ſay unto him, that I hold it for more difficult, that one who hath by the gift of God, Faith, Hope and Charity, ſhould
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:99333:231"/> deprave himſelf in ſuch manner, that he ſhould looſe them, and with them ſhould looſe his Juſtice, his Holineſſe, and his Piety; then it is for another, who is by naturall gift magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, valiant, and liberall, to come to make himſelf ſo puſillanimous, ſo fearfull; and ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, that he ſhould looſe his magnanimity, valour, and liberality. And I will ſay moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto him, that as it is a ſecure thing for the magnanimous, valiant, and liberall to live upon his guard, ſuſpecting himſelf, that if he ſhould grow negligent, he might come to looſe his magnanimity, his valour, and his liberality: ſo likewiſe is it a ſecure thing for the Juſt, Holy, and Pious to live upon his guard, ſuſpecting himſelf, that if he ſhould grow negligent, he might come to looſe Faith, Hope and Charity, and with them Juſtice, Holineſſe, and Piety. It is very true, that I ſhall hold him for much more ſecure, who by the inward ſpirit ſhall be aſſured that he can by no means come to looſe his Juſtice, his Holineſſe and his Piety, then that other, that alwayes lives upon his watch ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of himſelf. For I underſtand that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity which is divine, mortifies, and kills all the deſires of ſinning, as that which is humane quickens them, and kindles them. And I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand alſo, that the ſuſpecting, which is as it were a fearing, even when it is of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, being a thing proper to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is a
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:99333:231"/> thing of imperfect Chriſtians; it being proper to the perfect Chriſtians who have much Faith, much Hope and much Charity, to ſay with S, <hi>Paul, who ſhall ſeperate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
               <p>Here I will adde this. That as Liberality is ſo annexed to Magnanimity, that he cannot be magnanimous that is not liberall; ſo Hope and Charity are ſo annexed unto Faith, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould have Faith, who hath not Hope, and Charity; it being alſo impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that one ſhould be juſt without being Holy and Pious. But of theſe Chriſtian verities they are not capable, who have not experience in Chriſtian matters, which they onely have, who by the gift of God, and by the benefit of Chriſt have Faith, Hope, and Charity, and ſo are Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Holy, and Juſt in Chriſt, and do attend to comprehend that Piety, that Juſtice, and that Holineſſe, in which they are comprehended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like unto God, and to the Sonne of God Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, AMEN.</p>
